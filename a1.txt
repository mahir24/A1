It adds some [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment. <br /> <br />One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read. <br /> <br />The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K workflow while introducing their own artistic approach. <br /> <br />No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" does a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. <br />	2005-10-14

It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.	2005-10-14

The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talking about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everything together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anything close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).  Most of us will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.

I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  <br />	2005-10-14

He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.

In my mind, it is his [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico	2005-10-14

I have searched and searched for a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night.

Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

So I also asked to proofread \\"Dawn of a Thousand Nights: A Story of Honor.\\" Again, I was definitely NOT disappointed! I literally had to MAKE myself slow down so I could proofread carefully! I was hooked from the first page. It's definitely a 5-star book--a fascinating read, sad because of Pearl Harbor & other elements but also hopeful. It also takes place in WWII. We are there at Pearl Harbor; we are there with the women fliers (WAFS/WASPS) who transported planes across the country to free up male pilots for the war (one of the aspects of WWII I didn't know about until this book). We are also there in the Philippines, including the Bataan Death March & the horrid Japanese POW camps. Yet even through some of the worst circumstances of the war, this gifted author shows us that God truly cares & loves each of His children, & He can & will bring victory out of defeat. Such a powerful message of hope, love, & grace!       Historical figures are included, but the fiction & history mesh well. Readers even get to \\"see\\" from a Japanese point of view. The characters are compelling; I couldn't wait to know what happened to them! There is a touch of romance, but it's not overdone. This book is much more about the history, the people who lived it, and what they experienced during WWII. It's packed with emotions from those historical events: realism, fear, hope, faith, & love in the midst of extremely difficult times...& the gamut of emotions those who lived through WWII experienced. This is truly a unique and compelling book with characters who have depth & conflicts; I felt like I was there in each of the three main character's minds. Each of the chapters starts with actual historical newspaper excerpts, which adds a unique realism not always found in novels.      I have proofed well over 600 books, & I write reviews on VERY few. But Tricia Goyer's books are, quite simply, excellent!I have not found another author like her, and I am immensely thankful that I got to work on this book. I had to have \\"Night Song,\\" and since I didn't get to proof that, I bought it. Even though \\"Dawn\\" may seem like a long book, it's well worth your time! I love historical books that I can \\"sink my teeth into\\"--ones that have depth and a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K story mixed with history--not short, shallow books that only use history as a backdrop or setting.     This book was my jumping-off place to learn more about the war in the Pacific & the Bataan Death March. If you love WWII historical novels, you won't be able to put this book down! It has stayed with me since May 2004! Don't miss this! I'm so glad I didn't. :-)     I've already asked the publisher if I can proofread Tricia Goyer's next book. I can hardly wait! :-) I cannot recommend   this book highly enough! Enjoy!	2005-10-14

As is the case with many adventure books it is obvious that the author is not a professional writer. If you are looking for a well written book this is going to be a disappointment. If you don't care so much about the writing and just want to learn of a remarkable athletic/mental accomplishment this is a good book.  <br /> <br />Anyone familiar with ultrarunning will be familiar with the Badwater course. No doubt they will also be in awe of the Badwater course. It is viewed by some as the pinnacle of human endurance and the high point of ultrarunning in general. <br /> <br />Richard Benyo makes the Badwater race look like a jog through the park. He ran an out and back from the scorching floor of Death Valley to the windy and cold peak of Mt. Whitney and back. What makes it even more impressive is tha the did this years ago before the advent of energy gels, high performance sports drink, wicking fabrics and high tech running shoes. <br /> <br />This book probably won't appeal to non runners or even casual runners but anyone serious about running or human endurance will most likely appreciate it.	2005-10-14

In The Shadow Within, Abramm comes home to Kiriath to claim his crown after the death of his last older brother. His arrival is heralded by a sea-monster hunt of epic proportions, which leaves Abramm open to accusations of sorcery and deceit. Abramm must contend with various family members and nobles, unaware of his fame as a professional fighter and skeptical of his ability to reign, and with trouble on the borders and neighboring countries. Complicating matters is a Chesedhan princess who insists on digging up his past and composing heroic songs of his exploits. But the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest threat to Abramm and the realm is a creature born of sorcery and malice, blood-bonded to Abramm himself, created to destroy him and open the way for dark forces to control the throne of Kiriath through his younger brother. <br /> <br /> At this point, especially after re-reading the story, I've lost all objectivity about Karen Hancock's writing, or her stories, and have become a total fangirl. Though many other CBA authors have been compared to J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, none others have come so close to matching the scope and wonder of these two classic, beloved authors. I was thoroughly drawn into this segment of the tale and found my affections unexpectedly engaged not only by Abramm himself, all over again, but various secondary characters-Uncle Simon, Lady Madeleine, and the boy servant, Jared. More depth is given to Abramm's twin sister Carissa, as she must face her lingering rancor over Abramm's spiritual decisions. And the crowning point of the book is a marvel of love, faith, and the power of true fellowship. <br /> <br /> It's no surprise that The Shadow Within won the author her third Christy award for the third year in a row. Along with other dedicated Hancock fans, I wait with bated breath for Shadow Over Kiriath, the next installment of the four-part Legends of the Guardian King, due out November 2005. <br />	2005-10-14

I hung on to the book for several years and then, one hurricane week, without electricity and no work, I lit a candle and sat down to read ORENDA.  It has become one of my favorite books. Steeped in history, with a tale so compelling that I almost couldn't bear to finish it, I rushed out and bought all the other Kate Cameron (a.k.a. Beverly McGlamry) books I could find.  She is a writer of inestimable talent.  Her tale, while fictional, is woven within the tight constraints of factual history, so there are moments of gruesome reality. But this is juxtapositioned against a story of beauty, family, land and loss.  You needn't be particularly interested in the saga of the Iroquois Nation (on which this book is based) but I promise that you will be drawn in as easily as I was, to a world I never knew about.  This is a story beautifully told, of [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K moments and tragic ones, all exquisitely written with the true hand of a master historian.	2005-10-14

The United States has made some fundamental changes in its foreign policy as a result of the 9/11 attacks. These largely center around the almost unilateral decisions to change the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States had the power to do this, and exercised that power.  <br /> <br />It appeared unlikely that the US would get UN approval or a UN based coalition to work together. France and Russia were getting favorable oil pricing from Iraq in exchange for weapons and would likely veto any decision in the Security Council. The addition of numerous Islamic states into the General Assembly. So the decision was made to proceed anyway. It was certainly popular with the American people still operating in [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K anger after 9/11.  <br /> <br />Americans tend to believe with an almost religious fervor that our way is best, that the America system (under God) is clearly the way that the world should work. Americans believe that their global actions are benevolent, that the rest of the world is almost child like, and should look up to us as a father.  <br /> <br />The rest of the world doesn't exactly agree. The Islamic countries look at the US support of Israel and see a contempt for Islam. Europe looks at the US with some alarm. President Bush is often viewed as some kind of pistol packing Texas cowboy.  <br /> <br />Any book like this is a snapshot of the situation at a given time as seen by one person, the author. He certainly presents an interesting fview of other states worred about US dominance and who are starting to turn their concerns into action.  <br /> <br />It's an interesting book to read now, and it will be interesting to read in ten years or so to see just how a good a predictor Dr. Walt turns out to be.	2005-10-14

I just have to say that AH is a superior dictionary for everyday use.     I work for companies that maintain online dictionaries, and am, among other things responsible for comparing the contents of these lists with the latest published dictionaries to ascertain which entries should be deleted and which new ones included. I find that AH very rarely has bad judgement with respect to selection of entries.     Perhaps the reason another reviewer didn't find Carl Gauss or Reimann is because their names are actually Karl Gauss and Riemann. And I appreciate the fact that AH has gone a long way toward rectifying the perception conveyed by most older biographical dictionaries that all [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K people have been white, European and male. We need Gauss in there of couse, but we also need Robeson and St. Vincent Millay who won a Pulitzer Prize just like Frost, and who wrote just as beautifully.     Its goal obviously is to both be a desktop dictionary in a single volume, and yet include the words that educated American speakers are likely to encounter in modern, non-technical publications. (And yes, it is an American dictionary, which is why colour is defined as 'Chiefly British, variant of color'.) This objective becomes harder and harder to achieve as the base of English-speaking people expands, and the Internet makes so many more things available to the average reader. The average person may use words like 'alacrity' less often than they did 200 years ago, but in point of fact, the average person's active vocabulary is expanding.     I prefer the way they organize their word senses to what Webster does. (I never compare things to the OED, because that is a work of art, deserving of veneration.) It reserves entirely new entries for an entirely unrelated sense. AH will give iris(flower) and iris(of the eye) two different senses, but Webster's gives (though not entirely consistently) the nominal and verbal senses of, say, 'claim' entirely different entries. AH includes them under the same entry, because they are semantically very closely related.     The etymological Appendix of AH is also kind of famous among linguists. They have very nicely systematized and cross-referenced their entries against their hypothesized Indo-European roots. It's quite well researched, and also a lot of fun.	2005-10-14

I thought of several different ways in which to begin this review - several witty comparisons that would surely catch the reader's attention. But that was a month and a half ago. See, I started reading Blue Like Jazz on the 20th of July and it is now the 4th of October. I have four pages left and I'm not sure I have the strength to continue.    For you see: Donald Miller is wearying. Endlessly self-amused and self-absorbed, he seems to want nothing so much as to be hip, cool, edgy (despite his own protests that hip, edgy, and cool are vanities and wastes of time and energy). And if four years of highschool taught me anything, it is that everyone with a heart is thoroughly and deeply embarrassed when the Very Not Cool Guy walks in and tries to be cool. Think: The Offspring's \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy.\\"    The thing is: Christianity cannot be cool. There is no reason non-believers should see Christianity as anything even on the same plane as Cool. Christianity says and believes terrifying things about the non-believer. Forget the homosexuals a minute - Christianity says that the friendly, tax-paying, socially-active, community-leading paragon of virtue who doesn't bow the knee to Christ is horribly wicked and an actual enemy of God. No matter how kind and cool they are. For Christianity to become cool, it has to stop having anything to do with Christ and his message. Maybe Donald Miller wants that. It kinda seems like it, but who can say - since he's not that [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K at expressing anything beyond his own meandering and fleeting feelings on matters.    About two-thirds into the book, a friend (who won't receive an identity via nickname, such as Tony the Beat Poet or Andrew the Protester) asked me what kind of a book it was. I had a hard time describing it at first. Then I realized: \\"OMG!! I'm reading a blog on paper! LOL!!\\" Really, Miller's book is nothing more than a glorified blog in its meandering promise to get to a point that never comes. In reality, Miller wouldmake a much better blogger than he does a writer. Unfortunately, even as a blogger, he would only be so good - because despite moments of value and bits that come close to insight, his style is heavy-handed and obvious for too much of the book's 240 pages (I know, only 240 pages and it's taken me almost two-and-a-half months!).     One good-but-obvious point Miller makes throughout the book is that the human expression of Christianity in the contemporary American church is lacking at best, gravely flawed at worst, but most likely, somewhere in between. This is clearly true. But also clearly known to probably most of us. And the real problems are not often the ones that Miller is pointing out - he seems frequently upset at how little the church fits in with a world filled with lovely sinners. Yet still, there is value in his critique.    But not much. Again Miller shows himself to be like too many bloggers; and like too many bloggers, he has much criticism and too few answers. If he were a blogger, this might be acceptable; after all, the only cost associated with reading a blog is time (and perhaps mental health). A book, however, is paid in currency. There is real loss if a book does not measure up to its published value - and Blue Like Jazz does not. I hate to say that because there are a few amusing stories and I get the feeling the book wants to be useful - but it just isn't.	2005-10-14

The Autobiography of Ramtha's life <br />Part 2.  The Fundamental concepts of the teachings. <br /> <br /> <br />The Introductory Essay describes the background to Ramtha's teachings and highlights their uniqueness.  Not only do they address the fundamental questions of our origins and nature, but they deliver a comprehensive legacy of knowledge based on pure reason and science.  Coupled with this, are disciplines which give the student a means to experience and verify the philosophical aspects of the teachings, thus consolidating the knowledge as their own wisdom and personal truth. <br />Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) is likened to the ancient mystery schools of Egypt, Greece and Persia.  As a school, it provides the fertile ground in which the student can expand and liberate their mind from their old indoctrinations and find their freedom through the exploration of their spiritual nature. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 1 <br />Ramtha the Enlightened One talks of his life 35,000 years ago and what led him to become a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K warrior and conqueror.  He describes his recovery after being run through by a sword which led to his own self mastery and final ascension in front of his 2 million strong army. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 2 <br />Ramtha discusses our origins from the Void, the creation of time and the eventual evolution of the human form.  He describes the nature of God - the Observer and how reality is formed.  In addition, he explains how the brain works, the electromagnetic field around the body and how we can change.

In his foreword to the third edition, Aitken Roshi stated:   <br /> <br /> \\"this revised edition . . .now includes many new translations and studies of Dogen, and thus it is most welcome. Dogen wrote at the outermost edge of human communication, touching with every sentence such mysteries as self and other, self and non-self, meditation and realization, the temporal and the timeless, forms and the void.@He wrote of the attitude necessary for understanding, of the practice required. . .of the various insights that emerge, and of the many pitfalls. He did not generally write for beginners - most of his points require very careful study and a few of them elude almost everybody. These challenges are compounded by his creative use of the Japanese language. It has been said that he wrote in \\"Dogenese,\\" for he made verbs of nouns, nouns of verbs, created new metaphors, and manipulated old sayings to present his particular understanding. . . \\"  <br /> <br /> Prof. Kim's study has been based on a careful reading of Dogen's chosen idioms. He has endeavoured to amplify Dogen's understanding of 'do-ri' - or 'reason of the way.' Kim is keen to show that Dogen's use of Zen language is not merely provisional or instrumental, but embodies a 'realisational' dimension. This is exemplified in the notion of the 'genjo-koan' or koan realised in the present, which is to say, actualised in every day activity. In this way, Kim endeavours to show that Dogen's Zen culminates in ' the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K way of total exertion' (gujin no daido) or the total actualisation of practice as realization. Kim is a foremost interpreter of Dogen's thought - and, as such, this book deserves a place in every Buddhist library. My only reservation about this study, is that it might have made better sense of the question of how the so-called 'instrumentalist' aspect of koan practice relates tothe 'realizational' aspect. Quite rightly, Kim is at pains to point out that accounts of Zen which stress the 'instrumentalist' view of koan practice - and that alone, are one sided, and he has therefore endeavoured to illustrate a different perspective. However, without reflection, we might be left to conclude that Rinzai Zen favours the 'instrumentalist' view - and Soto, the 'realizational' view. Kim knows better, and indeed, in places (p. 165), he has cited certain remarks from Dogen, which concede that the term 'genjo-koan' originated with Engo - a Rinzai master of the Sung, evidently meaning that Rinzai practitioners have appreciated the 'realizational' aspect. As such, the critical references to (Dai-e) Ta-hui which appear elsewhere in the book, seem strangely out of tenor with this fact. Yuan-wu (Engo) was Ta-hui's teacher, and the latter must surely have known of his master's references to the genjo-koan. Conversely, much as we might identify Dogen's Zen with 'shikantaza' (just-sitting), playing down the instrumentalist approach, Dogen also had his experience of 'casting off mind and body' (shinjindatsuraku) - a breakthrough experience more or less akin to that realised by Rinzai followers. Perhaps Prof. Kim will enlighten us on this unresolved problem, at some future point.	2005-10-14

The Baroque cycle is a study in intricate plots, characters that seem to number in the thousands, and difficult material that is not readily accessible to the average novel reader.  The Cryptonomicon met that description as well, but to a lesser degree.  While I enjoyed those books precisely for their complexity, many readers probably found them to be frustrating to read and difficult to follow. <br />  <br />The Stephen Bury novels do not present this problem for the casual reader.  They are stripped of most of the technical lingo, and they tend to follow more in the footsteps of modern thrillers.  The difference between these novels and the average Tom Clancy clone is that they revolve around powerful critiques of modern political cultures and bureacracies. <br /> <br />The Cobweb is the better of these two novels.  The central critique of the intelligence community is that competence without political acumen is tantamount to career suicide.  The book tracks the months between Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the start of Gulf War I and poses a terrifying question: what if the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest enemies to our national security are the egomaniacs at the top of the security apparatus?  Given the events that have transpired in between the writing of this novel and today, the question raised by this novel seems prescient. <br /> <br />The one thing that is lacking from the Stephen Bury novels is the decadence of Stephenson's other works.  Stephenson is a novelist who has spent pages discussing the Captain Crunch-eating ritual of one of his characters (Cryptonomicon), the making of watered steel blades (the Baroque Cycle), and other incidental but vastly entertaining subjects too numerous to mention.  These passages exquisitely sideline the plots of his books for an exercise in pure intellectual indulgence.  Sadly, you will not find any such passages in this novel or in Interface.	2005-10-14

There are nine prefectures, the tenth is Reblic Territory in the middle of the Inner Sphere.  The names he used were familiar Anglican names like Thomas, Ray, Max, Blake, Victor, Kim, Andrea, with a few strange ones tossed in liek Bianca, Ring, and Gypsy.  Pep was a nickname for being small and quick.  Count Hector is the master.  In Santa Fe, North America, there is a Terra Prefecture X, called the Republic of the Sphere.    War is a silly little game where nobody wins.  Huxley commends: \\"Logical consequences are the scarecrows of fools and the beacons of wise men.\\"  Wise men think twice before they act once.  Trostsky felt that \\"an ally has to be watched just like an enemy.\\"  An ancient slogan used proclaims \\"Power corrupts, but absolute power is kind of neat.\\"  Sounds made up to me.    Daniel Boorstin feels that \\"the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.\\"  Napolean who lost the Battle at Waterloo, stated: \\"A battle sometimes decides everything; and sometimes the merest trifle decides a battle\\" and \\"In war, as in love, we must come into contact before we can triumph.\\"    Accius is quoted as saying :Oderint, dum metuant.  Let them hate, so long as they fear.\\"   He waxes poetic with Shelley, \\"To that high Capital, where kingly Death keeps his pale court in beauty and decay, He came.\\"  Shakespeare qualifies for three quotes, \\"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; They kill us for their sport,\\" \\"\\"It is to be all made of faith and service...it is to be all made of fantasy,\\" and \\"I am as true as truth's simplicity, and simpler than the infancy of truth.\\"    This is in the form of a narrative by Mason Dunne.  \\"I was in combat, no doubt about it, but I was detached from it.  I knew then that I had to be a Ghost Knight.  I saw another vision.\\"  The fish sees the bait, but not the hook.

Kaufman & Marc Connelly teamed up to write this play that was first presented in New York in 1924.  It is an adaptation of a 1911 German play by Paul Apel whose translated title is \\"Johnny Sunstormer's Trip to Hell.\\"  Kaufman & Connelly thoroughly Americanized the piece.  It is an example of expressionism, where the character's inner life is reflected in decidedly non-realistic stage terms.<br /><br />Neil McRae is a struggling composer who has caught the eye of Cynthia Mason who lives across the hall.  She helps tether Neil's feet to the ground regarding appointments and the necessity to complete work.  Neil's head is in the clouds, dreaming of the symphony he seems to not find time to write.  A buddy of Neil's from his hometown of Livingston, Dr. Albert Rice, drops in for a visit.  This happens just as a family from their hometown also drops in for a visit.  Mr. & Mrs. Cady come with their son Homer and their daughter Gladys.  Mr. Cady is a wealthy but grumpy entrepreneur.  Homer is also a businessman who seems tied to the phone making business calls while Gladys is a debutante socialite concerned with the color of her dresses.  Gladys for some unknown reason has a crush on Neil and pursues him.  His buddy Albert who sees Neil wasting his time giving lessons rather than writing encourages him to marry Gladys as a way to help him out of his money woes.  Although Neil has an eye for Cynthia across the hall, she also sees how he'd be more able to write his music if he marries into the wealthy family.  After the Cady's leave, Cynthia rejects Neil for his own good, although she deeply cares for him.  This causes Neil to pick up the phone and propose to Gladys who gushes that she can now start telling all her friends and planning engagement parties.  Dr. Albert, seeing that Neil is near exhaustion, orders him to bed.  Neil falls asleep thus starting the main part of the play, which is an extended expressionistic dream sequence.<br /><br />In the dream, locations fade from one to another where Mr. Cady makes Neil join the family business.  Everytime Neil wants to work on writing music, there is always another party to which Gladys drags him.  Frustrated and increasingly unhappy, Neil is finally put in an art manufacturing company where songwriters turn out nice jazz tunes that will sell a million and a half.  Ideas come from the inspiration department and are forwarded to the composer who dashes off the tune.  Writers turn out books that copy much of the plot from their previous book to meet publishing deadlines that results in books being distributed 45 minutes after they are written.  Neil's agony increases to the point where he picks up a paper knife and kills Mr. & Mrs. Cady, his wife Gladys and his brother-in-law Homer.  This starts an epic trial where tickets for jurors are sold like movie theatre tickets and the jurors are dancing instructors who dance with Gladys.  The judge is none other than the dead Mr. Cady and the deceased Mrs. Cady comes back as a witness.  Albert becomes the prosecuting attorney and objections are made to Neil's looks.  The jury does not care for Neil's looks and convicts him.  This ends the dream.<br /><br />Gladys shows up to inquire if they could postpone their engagement because she's run into one of her old boyfriends who wants to show her the city; and of course, he wouldn't be comfortable doing so if she's engaged.  Neil and Gladys decide they are not meant for each other which allows Neil to set his sights back on Cynthia who has now returned and is willing to settle for a life that is less successful but is filled with love.<br /><br />It is an interesting play, one that would require a legion of stagehands and set designers to produce effectively.  It is an indictment of business vs. art, something with which both Kaufman & Connelly seem extremely knowledgeable.  I couldn't quite figure out what the title had to do with the play, but I did appreciate reading this [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K example ofAmerican expressionism.

As a physician and early American history buff I was really looking forward to learning more about Benjamin Rush.<br /><br />In general it seems that the author, despite putting out what appears to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source materials to find out who Benjamin Rush was and why he was important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush's fame and accomplishments and influence, but the details are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K doctor Rush was, considered the preeminent physician of his times, according to the author, but all the author writes about is how Rush tortured his patients with medical treatments we now know are harmful, such as bloodletting, giving cathartics, etc.  Rush is known as the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", his book on psychiatry was bible for many many years, and his observations on mental illness were in many ways way way ahead of his times...yet not a word of this is mentioned except in the last ten pages of this 365 page book.  This subject desperately needed to explained.  This is why he is important for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinating to have gotten a better feel for what bloodletting and giving cathartics was about, we needed some good old source material, firsthand observations and then-current thoughts, as well as an expose of the tools employed, etc.  Rush, it is clear, considered himself first and foremost and physician.  He dedicated his life to the practice of medicine, he was considered a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physicians for the next half century were either disciples of Rush or disciples of his students.....but we don't really get a feeling for why.<br /><br />His political contributions and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibre of Hamilton or Jefferson, he was definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seemed to focus on explaining the political events occurring around Rush during the fight for independence.  The focus should have been Rush.  There's a lot of negativity surrounding Rush early on in the book, but how he seems to know all the important figures in the Revolution and why they respect him is not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any pictures or illustrations.  I could go on.  On the bright side, at least the book reads well.  If you want to learn more about Rush, you should probably choose another book.  Sorry.	2005-10-14

For anyone who loves horses, mules, romance, camping and the Mountain West, High Country has been well worth the wait. In this action packed story, Wyman masterfully tells of Ty Hardin, son of a Bitteroot Valley rancher, who leaves the farm during the Depression for a packer's life in Montana's Swan Range. Ty learns the ropes from a Fenton Pardee, a veteran guide, who also becomes his mentor and close friend. Tending to dudes and hunters, crossing snowbound passes, fording swollen rivers, encounters with bogs and bears, mule wrecks of epic proportions - and coming of age in town -  High Country captures the fears, dreams and fantasies of all who live for life on the trail. <br /> <br />This book is a tale of riveting adventure, romantic love, profound sadness and natural beauty which is hard to put down. I honestly didn't want it to end. On one hand it is unique simply because it focuses on the packing industry and its culture - topics which, as literature, haven't been seen much on the printed page.  <br /> <br />On the other, more than just a first in its genre (does another packer's adventure novel even exist?), High Country is also a profound description of the people and landscapes all of us as westerners love - high country landscapes, before coffee table books, when wilderness was something to be experienced fist hand.  <br /> <br />High Country is a book you'll want to throw in your saddlebags  and talk about around the campfire. Like your favorite camping trip, warm memories of High Country will last long into the night. If you like the Mountain West, this is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K read in every way.

First-rate historian and author Niall Ferguson offers a politically incorrect interpretation of the four-century history of the British Empire. Sure, he acknowledges that the imperialists stole, murdered and enslaved on their way to world domination. Yet, Ferguson argues, the Brits spread several traditions, including liberty, democracy and free trade, which improved the state of the world. To Ferguson's credit, he makes no attempt to gloss over the Empire's atrocities. In fact, with stellar prose, he takes the risk of undermining his central theme by describing the Empire's bad behavior in [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K detail.

It wasn't just a simple battle for the possession of the Shikon Jewel. The twist of making Inuyasha become a human for a night was also a clever twist in the plot. Rumiko seems full of surprises in what is essentially an action manga. Excellent work!	2005-10-14

I have little interest in or knowledge of designer clothes or the fashion world, and I don't subscribe to or read any fashion magazines.  That was exactly why I passed by this book several times before finally picking it up this weekend.  I thought it was going to be some story with a character I couldn't possibly relate to-- someone steeped in fashion who only cared about appearance.   <br /> <br />When I read the first few pages with Andrea IN the designer clothes, I thought I was right... but to my pleasant surprise, the main character turned out to be someone I could relate to and respect.  As a recent college graduate, I know from personal experience that the prospect of finding a job... getting a job... and trying to figure out a career are incredibly common to anyone in the relative age range of 21-24.  It's no easy task to deal with a first \\"real\\" job and the trials it provides while keeping an eye out for what comes next, because, inevitably, there will be a next.  No one stays in their first, entry-level, junky job, but this is a perfect read for the people who ARE in their first, entry-level, junky jobs. <br /> <br />What I found most impressive about this book is the way that, just like Andrea gets sucked into the lifestyle surrounding her job, the reader gets sucked into her goals for the future and how the job will get here there.  Towards the end, even as you realize it's wrong, it's so easy to rationalize (along with Andrea) that this is what she needs to do to secure her future; that she only has a few more weeks left-- all the while knowing deep down that, really, it's totally ridiculous.   <br /> <br />If you've ever had or have a boss who drives you insane for any reason, this is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book to read because it will show you that your boss is a picnic in the park.  Well worth the read.	2005-10-14

This was just the kind of romance novel I love. Wonderful characters. Characters that seem real because they are not perfect-something most novels like this lack. There are interesting plot twists and we get to know several secondary characters well. The secondary characters are not boring. The chemistry between Brianna and Michael was very sensual and immediate. The heroine is the perfect foil for the hero's cynicism and intellect. It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with both the palatable passion and the keen sense of danger infused in the story. Brianna and Michael were both wounded, intriguing, complex, wonderful characters. The action/suspense was fast-paced and thrilling. The setting was beautiful and exotic. The sex was HOT and perfect for the story. Melody Thomas stories are humorous, romantic and interesting - and she is excellent and creating characters that are real, interesting people - and that you remember vividly from book to book throughout the series. You want to know them better! I love the Donally family. This is the second book I have read from Melody Thomas and I love them both. I'm looking forward to reading more about the Donally family. All I can say in conclusion is if you like a good, emotional, heart-tugging historical, with characters that leap off the pages, buy  Must Have Been The Moonlight.	2005-10-14

Countless Americans patiently trace genealogies and histories through slowly crumbling archives and weathering marble, seeking answers to questions about the ones who preceded us.   This is a story of the meaning of such a search to one searcher.  As the book's title alludes, Recovering Ruth: A Biographer's Tale focuses on how recovering Ruth Edgerton Douglass' history affects her biographer, Robert Root.  Parts of Ruth's journal are excerpted in Recovering Ruth, and those who are interested in reading her journal in its entirety can look to Time by Moments Steals Away: The 1848 Journal of Ruth Douglass, edited by Robert Root.  <br /> Root's task, as the book begins, is seemingly simple and straightforward: edit the 1848 journal of Mrs. C. C. Douglass for publication.  The Michigan library catalog attributes the authorship to Lydia Douglass, the clan matriarch who lived to be an octogenarian.  However, Root soon discovers that the journal was actually penned by the first Mrs. C. C. Douglass, Ruth Edgerton Douglass.  This discovery compels him to reconstruct the people and places of the mid-nineteenth century Michigan frontier, from the then-booming young city of Detroit to the remote Lake Superior outpost, Isle Royale.  Although his search begins in libraries and archives, he soon journeys to the places where Ruth triumphed over fears common to us all: loneliness, hardships, and loss.  <br /> In retracing her life's journey, Root travels from Detroit to Chicago to Lake Superior's Isle Royale. Root uses his carefully researched details to evoke the Michigan Ruth would have known.  He describes their approach of Isle Royale thus: \\"At last the island begins to rise in the distance, a long thin line above the water that slowly thickens as we thump our way steadily across the waves\\" (109).  His language not only shows the vastness of the Great Lake, but also the treachery and danger inherent in crossing the world's largest freshwater lake even for a modern traveler.  Imagery such as this gives us insight into the courage and determination of settlers such as the Douglasses. <br /> During the course of his timely yet timeless search, Root comes to realize that he is in search of the meaning not only of Ruth's life, but of his own.  As Root says, \\"Perhaps I needed to recover Ruth in order to keep from losing myself\\" (xvi).  History is comprised of a series of chance meetings and fortunate accidents not readily apparent by perusing a family tree.  Our lives would be immeasurably different if our [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K-grandparents had decided that it was, after all, too difficult to make their way by wagon train westward to Kansas, if our grandmother had stayed home rather than attended a dance, if our father's soulful brown eyes hadn't met our mother's at a crowded wedding.  Root directly acknowledges those subconscious murmurs: \\"Genealogy identifies lines of descent, who begat whom, the aftermath of events; what it doesn't recount are the myriad alternatives barely missed, the intangibles of attraction and attachment, the possibilities avoided, ignored, or rejected\\" (25).  In recovering Ruth's story, Root sees the ways in which his own choices will impact the future course of history: a painful divorce, a hopeful remarriage, his beloved children.   <br /> Root's work serves as a window for us to view the interconnections between our world and Ruth's.  As George Eliot wrote at the end of Middlemarch, \\"the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.\\"  In Recovering Ruth, Root has recorded Ruth's historic acts and unveiled her hidden life.    <br />     This book was chosen by the Library of Michigan as a 2004 Michigan Notable Book.	2005-10-14

I would say only that before Hard Time John was a bastard, but he always seemed at least a little sorry for it. With Azrillo, the wishy washyness slipped completely away to reveal John for the conniving, sadistic unapologetic bastard everybody always thought he was. <br />Which isn't to say I liked Azrillo. He did horrible things to the character and the supporting cast, but in many ways his mark has been left. <br />If Carey's first collection, Red Sepulchre, attempted to crawl out of the ditch Hellblazer was left in, Black Flowers represents Carey, not to use an obvious metephor, in full bloom. <br />I expected [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K things from Carey the moment I heard he was takeing the reigns. Judging from the complex, continuing storylines of Lucifer, I figured this for a man who dreams up issues years ahead of schedule. <br />Yet for all its achievments with reoccuring plot threads, Hellblazer has never been much for one long, linked storyline. Until now... <br />I would not have believed he would try to tie in Red Sepulchre, in itself an impressive storyline, with anything larger. But in this I committed the inexcusible sin of underestimating Mike Carey. In this collection, he takes up the tone of his other magnificent works and makes Hellblazer unmistakably his own, without oweing apologies to anyone else. <br />His work is not at all choppy, each episode proceeds naturally into the next. But don't mistake continous and flowing for predictable, Carey is also the master of dropping little hints that never make sense until the puzzle is assembled. And then you realize what you thought of as the whole puzzle is but a piece of something larger. That is the joy. <br />But I'm rambling. The two-part title arc is perhaps the most other-wordly story I have read in some time, and the Three Doors story arc represents John at his con-man best. Nothing is ever as it seems, and Carey presents just enough information to let you think youknow what's going on. When all is said and done, you feel like you should have known what was going to happen, but you never can. <br />And the best is yet to come. Judging by the hints dropped in this book, and the way they simply beg for more information, Black Flowers will have Hellblazer fans and lovers of mystery and dark fantasy stories pleading for more. <br />Mike Carey is just getting started.	2005-10-14

Welsh is a wonderful, ancient language that has survived on the fringe of the island of Great Britain despite the dominance of its now world-wide-dominant neighbour, English.  The literary works, particularly the poetry, has [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K power, even when translated into English, and English speakers can get a sense of the flavour of this Celtic language from the various worlds that have been absorbed into English.<br /><br />This course created by T. J. Rhys Jones (about as Welsh a name as they come) is a very easy, step-by-step process to learn what is in many ways a very difficult language - particularly for English speakers, whose language comes from Germanic and Latinate roots, going to a Celtic language which stems from a different tree is truly an excursion into foreign territory.  Rhys Jones has made this trip quite enjoyable, and quite do-able.<br /><br />Unlike English, Welsh pronunciation is a lot less flexible in terms of matching spelling to sound, so learning the pronunciation is a bit easier to do.  The grammar seciont also looks at the way words are put together - like many languages, there are colloquial expressions and multi-word phrases that stand in for single English words, and vice-versa.  Each unit starts with a brief dialogue, which is then analysed for vocabulary and for grammar structure, and any other points of interest.<br /><br />There is also an introductory section on mutations, the shift of a sound from one to another depending upon use - Rhys Jones gives the examples of road signs:  the word for Wales is Cymru, but a border sign when crossing into Wales might read Croeso i Gymru; similarly, the word for England is Lloegr, but the sign might read Croeso i Loegr.  This is a codification in letters of what happens in regular speech - we do not as a rule stop and start between each word, and the spelling in Welsh takes this into account.<br /><br />There are a few difficulties with the text. While Rhys Jones indicates that there are dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.  As with any language text, I am more often to account the difficulty to myself than to the author of the instructional text.<br /><br />There is a glossary of words in the back, but I often found myself wishing it were a fuller dictionary rather than a simple word list.  There are exercises to work through, whose translations are found in the appendix, as well as more detailed tables on mutations, gender in language constructions, the special verb 'have', which in Welsh can be variously translated as gyda, cael, wedi, or rhaid.<br /><br />This is a useful text; used in connection with travel or a book of poetry (Dafydd ap Gwilym is one of my favourite poets).dialect differences, some of the words don't match what I heard while in Wales in any location.

Reviewers all over the country wrote reviews about how [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K it was. The initial sales were fantastic. It went immediately to a book club. Published in 18 (last I heard) countries. That was in the early summer of 2005. Switch to early fall. I see lots of places with the book for sale saying 'Publisher's Overstock.'  <br /> <br />John Twelve Hawks, the author, supposedly lives 'off the grid.' That is, no permanent address, no credit cards, no Social Security number, etc. Question -- how does he get paid royalties? For the publisher to pay him, they are going to want to deduct that expense on their taxes. To do that they have to have a Social Security number, a corporate ID, or possible make the payment to a foreign national in their own country. It's still good hype to have the author remain quite mysterious - no interviews, no book tour, no e-mail. He communicates only through his agent via scrambled-signal satellite telephone. How is the satellite phone account paid for?  <br /> <br />Anyway, the story. This book, the first of a trilogy, sets up a fight between the forces of light and darkness that is happening behind the scenes, off the grid if you wish.  <br /> <br />The bad guys are the Tabula. They're sort of like the Patriot Act run amok.  <br /> <br />The good guys are the Harlequins - no they don't write romance novels. They run around with swords in what I envision as  a 'Kill Bill' environment and fight the Tabula.  <br /> <br />Inbetween are the Travelers who have an ability to project their spirit into other worlds where they can receive wisdom to bring back to earth.	2005-10-14

Yes, I passed the test but not with the score I thought I would receive.  I ended up with a disappointed 794.  I read this book as well as the Exam Cram book thoroughly.  In addition, I have four year experience as a PC technician.  One might then inquire as to why the low score.  The answer is this:  the 70-270 test does not solely test your knowledge on Windows XP alone, as it should since there are separate tests for server, network management, active directory, etc.  You must have experience with Windows 2000/2003 server and Active Directory to get anything above an 850.  You will need to have an understanding of Group Policy (which is a server topic), Login Scripts (also a server topic) and Active Directory (which is a separate test itself).  Fortunately, I was able to get through it from the minimal experience I received from setting up a practice LAN with 2003 server with Active Directory installed.  However, I did not think that I would be tested on Windows Server or Active Directory, therefore, didn't study them.  If one were just to study this book as well as Exam Cram with no experience with 2000/2003 server, they would surely fail the test.

Although I concur with some of the criticism from some of my fellow reviewers below, and would not claim that its merit lay in either [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K writing or a fascinating plot, I found it reasonably balanced, thoughtful and stirring. The tale of modern day Afghanistan is not a pretty one, but it is one we need to hear. It is especially poignant when you consider the shift that has taken place there in so short a space of time. Hosseini deals with this aspect of his story effectively. In fact, I could translate the image of Afghanistan's awful political situation to the world stage: we are probably closer to our own Afghanization than we might like to think. <br /> <br />However, the true reason for liking the book, for enjoying it with hardly a hitch all the way through, is for its characterization. The main characters are all highly stereotyped - Assef the bully, Baba the heroic male, Amir the coward - except for Hassan. Hassan is a very fine portrait of what I might call \\"a beautiful soul.\\" This is very hard to achieve - a portrait of a character who is somehow reaching out from within, attempting whether consciously or unconsciously, to touch those around him and be at peace with the world, just as he finds it. If my hunch is right, Hosseini deliberately made the other characters stereotypical in order to highlight this one character. I think he has succeeded and it is very fine writing. There are also other levels working along with the more obvious main story. Who and what is the kite-runner? Is he not an evolving character with his own personality which develops throughout the book. What was Baba's point in going against established thinking and befriending an Hazara family, and \\"pissing on the beards\\" of the mullahs and so on? What was the point of describing Soroya's incursion into pre-marital sex? All of these and many other details seem to combine so that we are always, like the main character in the book, being forced to askquestions. And as in all good writing, the questions we have to answer are not about the book, but about ourselves.	2005-10-14

When sports figures write books on leadership, they often take the easy route - athletic metaphors, game time war stories, tenuous applications of sports experiences to business. This refreshing book breaks through such superficial ideas as decisively as a dunk by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in his prime. Ten-time national champion UCLA basketball coach John Wooden - generally considered the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest college basketball coach to ever hold a clipboard - delivers a leadership book that stands alone at center court. Remarkably, none of Wooden's players recall him urging them to win. Instead, he urged them to do their best every moment. Take care of the process, he says, and the result will take care of itself. To Wooden, preparation is pivotal and every detail matters. Despite his almost obsessive focus on getting the little things right, Wooden believes in balance and consistency. He avoids extremes. Wooden's long-time collaborator and co-author Steve Jamison does a wonderful job of portraying, through the coach, a range of qualities, philosophies and characteristics that apply to every field. We strongly recommend this book to managers and executives who want to know how to lead people to victory in every game.	2005-10-14

First, it speaks in generalities to the rise of the Profession of Arms and talks about the development of professional officers. The second major theme is that it dicusses command and control and the execution and management of violence. the thesis is that decision making, technology and professionalism are essential tools that now become part of the overall thought, deliberate strategy planning and development process of the military. Thirdly, it speaks to and explores tactical decisiveness and lastly, it speaks to international law and custom.<br /><br />All in all this is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book, but dont expect that the conclusions or answers to these themes will always jump out at you. You will need to read with intention to discern these 4 themes, and some others, and how they may or may not apply to your contemporary comparisons of Modern war, that is from roughly WW II to the Gulf War of 90-91 and Post-Modern War, that is, current warfare post 9-11.<br /><br />This two hundred year work of analysis ends where it begins. With the analysis of a decisive battle. The last 8 pages sum up a few of the auhtors conclusions; one that comes to mind is the political-military-business training and role that officers must have in order to perform there military roles effectively.<br /><br />The [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest benefit of this book will be derived when one compares post modern war with the tactical lessons of the battlefield.<br /><br />The academic debate rages, and will continue to rage over whether or not there is such a thing as the decisive battle. You will need to discern for yourself if the principles of war have changed and if the tactical execution of the battle has a direct correlation to the operational, strategic and or political aspects of war.<br /><br />ps. read this book slowly and with intention, there is much to absorb here.<br /><br />Terry Tucker, Prof Military Studies/History<br /><br />Senior Doctrine Developer SANGMP	2005-10-14

Stephen King is a fabulous writer who can really tell a story, and this is a good story to tell.  It's dark but (unfortunately) not supernatural at all.  It's not particulary gory but very scary.  Most of us know that the scariest stories are the ones that are plausible.  Unfortunately, this story is not only plausible but unfolding today in our society.  In that regard King is prescient since this book was written before modern schoolyard massacres.	2005-10-14

She doesnt give much explanation of Ceasor and the Romans, they are the bad guys and that is all the reader is given.

He made a name for himself as the country was being formed, especially with his defense of \\"the rules of law\\" against the will of the majority. He was one of the last of the old Federalists. He was a foreign minister to Holland, Portugal, and Prussia, and was Secretary of State under Monroe (where he was the main force in establishing the Monroe Doctrine). He became the sixth President in a controversial election that was decided in the House of Representatives.<br /><br />Parson's short (272 pages) but thorough and well-written biography of Adams is a job well done. She details the accomplishments of his life, but focuses primarily on the man himself. Adams was a stern man (his portrait reminds me of some evil Dickens character, Marley perhaps), and not well-liked by the public. He believed that one should not \\"run\\" for a political office, but should just accept it if offered (imagine that today!). He hated Andrew Jackson and slavery, and fought hard against both. This is an excellent book on an interesting man.	2005-10-14

Pound for pound, this may be the best book on, about, or for aspiring writers.   <br /> <br />I have read at least 10 books on the craft of writing and a bunch on theory and technique... this book is right up there with the best of the best.  If you couple this book with Raymond Carver's posthumous \\"Call if You Need Me\\" and mix in a few careful readings of any Richard Yates interview, you've got yourself some tough rope to tow.  But if you want to be a strong writer, suck it up and do it anyway! <br /> <br />I hold a BA in fiction writing.  I also tend to write literary realist fiction.  If you are of the same mind, this book will help you tremendously.  It is brutal in it's explanation of what to steer clear of and what to include, but that is how it should be.  If you take writing very seriously, and want to take it to the next level, this book is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K start. <br /> <br />You can't go wrong when you have advice from C. Michael Curtis (Fiction Editor of the most prominent publication in America) and Frank Conroy (Chairman to the most prestegious writing institute in America.)  Pay attention folks.  This is the real deal.  Add in some very helpful workshop activites from one Tom Bailey (only a head writing professor at Harvard) and some very heartfelt tips from a true master like Dubus... Forget about it! <br /> <br />\\"On becoming a Novelist\\" was good.  \\"ABCs of Reading\\" was good.  \\"The Lonely Voice\\" was decent.  Forster's guidance was revolutionary, but this book is perfect for now.  Go buy it and then read all the Carver and Yates and Dubus and Wolff you can get your grubby little hands on.  You'll be a better writer for it.  Trust me!	2005-10-14

Not only is this book useful for songwriters but for worship leaders and ministry musicians as well.<br /><br />Baloche and the Owens' navigate the theory and mechanics of song composition without being too lofty for beginners or too condescending for veterans.  Songwriters and worship leaders should get this book for its clinical value alone.<br /><br />Of special interest to writers of worship songs is the authors' perspective that it is more difficult to write a good congregational song than a good artist song-the implication being that most of us assume the opposite.  They call attention to the struggle, and necessary self-denial a songwriter experiences when trying to create truly [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K melodies with  fresh, imaginative lyrics that can all be readily owned by common, untrained singers.  It was both freeing and compelling to read through their thoughts on that.<br /><br />The book also examines the role that music plays in leading and expressing the emotions, and how valuable that is in completing the worship experience of the Church.

We can see in your book how his days and nights in the cottage helped Lincoln to  hold on to and expand what he had until victory in the 1864 election was assured. <br /> <br />The other is the loving relationship of the President with his wife, Mary Lincoln. We often hear of her oddities and running up of debts. What we do not hear of, and what admirably is stressed in your book, is what you describe as \\"the mutual affection and mutual dependence\\" that always linked them despite their [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K differences in character.

So I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />Not only did the author present some rather convincing evidence that Phillips was indeed Robert LeRoy Parker, alias George \\"Butch\\" Cassidy, but the book also turned out to be the most informative book which I have read on the inner workings of a true western outlaw gang.  If one is not convinced that Phillips was Cassidy, one must surely conclude that he was at least a member of Cassidy's \\"Wild Bunch.\\" <br /> <br />The most compelling evidence, in my view, is the following: 1) the opal ring which Phillips sent to Butch Cassidy's Wyoming sweetheart, Mary Boyd, shortly before his death (inscribed on the inside \\"Geo C to Mary B\\"); 2) Phillips' Colt Peacemaker with Butch Cassidy's brand carved in the handle, 3) the affirmative handwriting analysis comparing a letter known to have been written by Butch Cassidy with a later letter written by Phillips; and finally 4) Phillips' intimate knowledge of Butch Cassidy, his associates and the people he knew or worked with, the areas in which he lived and rode, and the robberies which he planned and carried out; all as  expressed in his unpublished [autobiography?] \\"The Bandit Invincible, the Story of Butch Cassidy.\\" <br /> <br />The most interesting thing to me about this book, however, is not whether or not William Phillips was, in fact, Butch Cassidy, it was the detailed descriptions of how Cassidy would plan and carry out his raids. I was also struck by the intimate details concerning the cattle wars in Wyoming and life as it really might have been in the old west.  I only wish that Phillips hadn't used a fictitious name for theSundance Kid in \\"Bandit Invincible\\" which was written in 1930.  If, as he said, he changed the names of living persons so as not to incriminate them, one can only wonder why he changed Harry Longabaugh's name in his book and yet described the manner in which he died.  That is a real puzzler. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was the way in which it skipped back and forth between Phillips' writings and information from the author's other sources, at the same time introducing lots of new people and information.  This seemed to confuse the issue and break the continuity (ergo, 5 to 4 stars).  All things considered, though, this is a truly remarkable story and a must read for anyone interested in the old west and its history. <br />	2005-10-14

Nietzsche was raised by his mother, grandmother and aunts; later in his life, his sister would become executor of his estate (after Nietzsche had become incapable of managing his own affairs) and reshape his philosophy and writings in her own idea - this becomes a running motif in later anthologies of Nietzsche; editors can quote and clip to fit their own agendas. In some ways, that is true of the text here, but in much less inappropriate ways than others, particularly Nietzsche's first editor, his sister.<br /><br />Nietzsche was a star pupil from his earliest days at university in Bonn and Leipzig. His formal study was in classical philology, but his attentions turned in various directions quickly during his writing and professional life - he had an intense interest in drama and the arts, with Wagner's music and Greek drama in principal interest. His first book was devoted to these topics - 'The Birth of Tragedy'. It was not highly regarded at the time, but has since become much more appreciated as an anticipation of later developments in philosophy and aesthetics.<br /><br />Nietzsche's life after this period was a very choppy one - he left the university, claiming illness, and while this developed later to be a true situation, at the time is was probably academic politics and difficulties fitting in with the establishment he was trying to break. He had a formal falling-out with Wagner, even writing later a piece entitled ' Nietzsche contra Wagner', finished just a few week prior to his going insane.<br /><br />In another edition, Walter Kaufmann states that Nietzsche's real career took off after his active life was over; under his sister's direction, many of the writings Nietzsche had managed to do and not get published, or which were published but forgotten, really took off in major directions. While his major works of Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, Will to Power and Genealogy of Morals were in various editions of disrepair (indeed, the Will to Power was never more complete than a series of notes), Nietzsche had a knack for language that made him very quotable, and his influence continued to grow well into the first half of the twentieth century, influencing art, philosophy, history, and politics in dramatic ways, if not always the ways in which Nietzsche envisioned.<br /><br />For example, Nietzsche was not particularly impressed with the 'typical' German anti-semitism, which later erupted into the Nazi movement. He considered it rather bourgeois, and while he undoubted had his own issues with Jews (Nietzsche had issues with almost everyone, particularly any group, Christians included, who had a religious connection), the Nazi use of Nietzsche's work owes more to Nietzsche's sister's influence than anyone else.<br /><br />'The Genealogy of Morals' is perhaps the closest in form to English-speaking philosophical discourse. This is a discussion that involves philosophy, psychology and linguistic theory, looking at morality in three different essays. The first essay explores the idea of good and evil as good and bad; Nietzsche develops the idea of master and slave morality - the slave resists the ideas of the master, and thus values things that are less likely to gain power - Nietzsche sees Christianity as an example of slave morality.<br /><br />The second essay looks at the issues of conscience and guilt, and how these spawned the invention of gods. The third essay concludes the work with a look at ascetic ideas, how these relate to aesthetic ideas, and where in Nietzsche's opinion the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K philosophers of the past have gone wrong.<br /><br />In his book Ecce Homo (first published posthumously), Nietzsche analyses his own workpiece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life. Nietzsche's insights into his own writings in hindsight is fascinating to behold. His own idea of 'The Genealogy of Morals' can be found in this piece as follows:<br /><br />'Regarding expression, intention, and the art of suprise, the three inquiries which constitute this Genealogy are perhaps uncannier than anything else written so far. Dionysus is, as is known, also the god of darkness.'<br /><br />Nietzsce is not easy reading, and this work is not the best for casual reading or the first-time reader of Nietzsche. However, for those who have already made some headway into understanding him, this is a good volume.e analyses his own work piece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life.

Actually it's one of the best books, period. <br /> <br />It's for many reasons: <br /> <br />Firstly, the main character isn't typical. She isn't a geek, a jock, or goth-- She's just...normal. A little sarcastic and anti-social maybe, but I connected with her instantly.  <br /> <br />It's a book that, while being mature, isn't drenched in the usual sex and blood that makes a good vampire book so hard to find. It's a romance, but it's nowhere near sweet. It's not overly wordy, either - you know what's going on.  <br /> <br />Edward is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K character to, and his family is especially endearing - particularly Alice. Meyer's imagination on what vampires would actually be like is really cool. No turning to stone in the sun, folks!  <br /> <br />All in all, I could not put this down.

It's another [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K story with wonderful characters we've come to know and love.   <br /> <br />I re-read the earlier books just before Snow & Ashes was published, and must admit that the series struck me a little bit like an old movie serial--with perilous situation after perilous situation.  And read back-to-back like that, it got a tad tedious, though I was pleased that in this book neither Claire nor Jamie were in mortal peril until after page 200.  On the whole, though, I found it a good mix of the exciting and the mundane.  (Unlike some reviewers in this forum, I very much like the depiction of details of their everyday life, and the ways Claire brings a little 20th-century medicine to 18th-century North Carolina.) <br /> <br />I don't quite understand the cries of \\"Cliffhanger. Aaagghh!\\" I've seen here.  I thought the ending was very straight-forward with no major questions left unanswered (except, perhaps, how Roger and Brianna afford their new real estate).  Perhaps I am taking things too much at face value, but I thought many more old questions were answered than new ones asked. <br /> <br />There were some quibbles with the book--I found Jocasta's behavior revealed at the end rather unbelievable, for example--but on the whole I thought it was a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K volume.

Giangregorio, Mikko Hrmeinen and Keith Bonn; and, Weapons Tables by Hugh Foster and Keith Bonn.   <br />As Glantz points out in the introduction, the four year struggle ranged over 600,000 square miles and killed tens of millions of soldiers and civilians. He contends that the very size of the Eastern Front War makes it difficult to comprehend it in detail and therefore to place it in context of the Russian contribution to overall victory and this is why this book is such a valuable addition to the literature on the war.  Slaughterhouse places a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal of information and succinct analysis in the reader's hands. <br />There is a wealth of data in this book, much of it technical.  Organizational tables show the composition of units down to brigade in some cases.  The Orders of Battle list all units from Army Group or Front down to division, along with date of activation, campaign history and successive commanders. As page after page rolls by in this section, 247 pages in fact, the reader can appreciate the massive scale of the conflict in the east. Every weapon used in the theater is listed in comparative tables which are comprehensive and easy to understand. Tanks, tank destroyers, all forms of small arms, all forms of artillery, assault guns, plus aircraft, including lend-lease air planes, appear side by side. Calibre, weight, rate of fire, range, crew, armor thickness, combat radius, speed, it is all here and as is typical of this well-researched book, many photographs of the weapons as well.  <br />Especially useful is the annotated chronology with well-placed maps which, in forty-five pages, provides the reader with an overview of the campaigns. Glantz sees the Battle of  Stalingrad as the decisive turning point of the war.  With regard to relative contributions to victory, Glantz's use of statistics demonstrates that even after the Normandy landings over sixty per cent of the German Army was still in the East and over sixty per cent of its losses as well.  <br />Glantz discusses also the role of Lend-Lease to the Soviets in the Allied victory. He determines that of the matriel the West delivered to the Soviet Union, vehicles, particularly trucks (55% of all used and 42% of jeeps), locomotives and rail cars, contributed most by logistically aiding Red Army offensives. If the Soviets had not received this assistance, he adjudges, it would have taken them 12 to 18 months longer to defeat the Germans.   <br />In the last chapter, Forgotten Battles, Glantz identifies several neglected operations which deserve research.  Here Glantz returns to one of his themes, namely that in order for a proper understanding of the war in the east, more must be known about the numerous counteractions the Red Army undertook during German offensives.  This is particularly so at the strategic level where the main question for Glantz is, to what extent did Stavka co-ordinate them and if so, what did the counteractions contribute to subsequent Soviet failures or successes.  <br />I found the biographical sketches of the senior officers very helpful and informative, especially the thirty-four Soviet portraits of commanders who are little known to the western reader or the Oxford Companion to World War II which has only 14. The book has a large select bibliography, a listof the finding aids for the captured German military documents at the National Archives, and a list of reliable websites.   <br />There is no better way to immerse oneself in the biggest and deadliest front of the war and to come away with informed insight than to read this book. <br />	2005-10-13

The only prerequisites are a very good understanding of set-theory and some knowledge of the theory of continuous functions (at the level of a first course in real analysis, e.g. Apostol's Mathematical Analysis). The development is patient and there is sufficient help for the beginner (full solutions at the back, and, for practice, unproved propositions in the text with proofs at chapter-ends). The coverage is not overwhelming and anyone with the requisite preparation can digest the book in a term's work. Measure theory on its own is an incredibly dry subject. The authors do a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K job of covering the essentials in about 300 pages, while making the subject interesting and applicable at the same time. A very attractive feature of the book is its brief focus on mathematical-finance applications.

Particularly, it shows how to conceptualize financial models measure-theoretically. A very useful little volume indeed!	2005-10-13

I have to say that this is an incredibly disappointing book. One would expect by the title that some form of rationale would be presented for supporting the title's claim but the author fails to provide any such thing. Instead, she squanders a wonderful opportunity by abusing the medium to vilify dispensationalists and dispensationalism and her disdain for such fills nearly the whole book like shrapnel from a hand grenade. She also notes an author who \\"points of the danger of anti-Semitism in dispensationalism.\\" This is absolute rubbish. While I have only been familiar with dispensationalism for a few years I have yet to notice anything resembling the like in any of their writings. One thing the author absolutely should not have done is equate the apocalyptic vision in Revelation with the \\"apocalyptic\\" story of Dickens's \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" She goes to [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K lengths to try and establish a connection between the two but she never really succeeds. The author also has the temerity to suggest that the plagues in Revelation may be punishment for the social ills and injustice that have been committed. There is absolutely nothing whatsoever to support this fantasy. Near the end of the book we are finally led to know just why she published this book. The book of Revelation presents a sequence of events put in motion by God to right all of the social ills and injustice in the world. We find that she interprets Revelation according to her own populist theology. God is avenging the downtrodden. It is this reviewer's hope that because of this reinterpretation this book will receive a very short shelf life.	2005-10-13

It is basically an unknown story, since what they teach us in school is almost all of it lies and myths, for example that Queen Elizabeth sold her jewells to finance the first trip, or that everybody in Columbus' time believed the Earth was flat. By any standard, Columbus was a bit of a lunatic who probably also suffered from what todat we call bipolar disease (for example, he thought that God spoke to him directly). He seems to have been given to theatricality and emotional blackmail, but undoubtedly he was also very intelligent and a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K navigator. He also had an urge for social climbing, and he longed for glory and fame more than for money. He was obsessed with finding a way to China, India and Japan by sailing West, which suited the Western European powers's commercial interests. As said before, in his time the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K debate among learned people was not over the flatness or roundness of the Earth, but about its size. Columbus, by grossly underestimating it, became convinced that the voyage to Asia was within reach. Had there been no American continent, he would have been murdered or starved to death. But he was also a very courageous and brave man, and so he made possible what seemed impossible. He was a very bad politician, and his emotional diseases made him quarrel with soon former friends, which of course marred his leadership abilities. His life, very well written by Fernandez-Armesto, is a glorious, tragic and incredible epic which reads like the best adventure novels.	2005-10-13

Finally, the fox represented the fact that Sir Gawain was planning to be sly and conceal the fact that the lady of the castle had given him her girdle.  The fact that he would lie to the lord of the castle, shows that he is truly human and that he would like to keep his own head when he has to go meet back up with the Green Knight the following day.  The hunt over three days represents a series of three tests which later comes to aid or hinder Sir Gawain in his quest to keep his oath as a knight and follow through with the guidelines of \\"the beheading game\\".  The girdle at the end that all the knights in King Arthur's court take to wearing symbolizes that they are human and that they are not perfect and that humility should be observed.	2005-10-13

No one would be foolish enough to categorically deny the possibility.  Nonetheless, we can say that if there is such a process, no one has a clue how it would work.  Further, it would go against all human experience, like postulating that a natural process might explain computers.\\"  \\"In the face of the massive evidence we do have for biochemical design, ignoring that evidence in the name of a phantom process would be to play the role of the detectives who ignore an elephant\\".<br /><br />Well this is just riddled with logical loops and holes.  First, who is he to say that no one has a clue how it would work?  He has already stated (pp 189-192) that Stuart Kauffman and others claim they have a clue, but he has already peremptorily dismissed them so now he is going to ignore them.  Second why does it go against all human experience?  We have ample human experience of coming to understand new natural processes and laws that have opened up whole new ways of understanding.  Theories of gravity, electromagnetic forces, atomic structure, DNA replication come immediately to mind.  So it is not at all beyond human experience to discover a new natural process with major explanatory power.  Third, what is illogical about postulating that a natural process explains computers?  Humans are natural systems, human culture is a natural system, and computers have arisen from that natural system.  Our computers are crude and undeveloped compared to the computational systems of the human brain or any organism's ability to derive and process information from its environment. Electronic computers are the result of natural processes which can occur when natural systems like human beings emerge from cellular structures.  Fourth, the conclusion of biochemical design is what is on trial when he suggests that an undiscovered natural process might be an alternative explanation for the \\"evidence\\" !  He can't then logically claim that the very same evidence rules out the undiscovered process!  This paragraph alone is enough to toss Behe onto the intellectual rubbish heap!<br /><br />Behe puts forth what I will accept as strong arguments that the theory of gradual mutation and natural selection is insufficient to explain biochemical processes and structures.  He then waves his hands, metaphorically speaking, in two chapters about intelligent design, using very poor logic.  He dismisses other people who agree with the limits of natural selection, using deprecatory tactics to deflect legitimate investigation into their work.  He mentions how Lynn Margulis was \\"initially patronized and ridiculed, [then] eventually won grudging acceptance - and then acclaim - for her idea that parts of the cell were once free-living organisms.  But, he points out, symbiosis, although important, cannot explain the origin of complex biochemical systems.  He then proceeds to himself patronize and ridicule Stuart Kauffman who does put forth a promising framework for the origin of complex biochemical systems.  First he directly equates Kauffman's proposals on biological systems with \\"complexity theory\\" itself, describes complexity theory as \\"a mathematical concept to describe the behavior of some computer programs\\", and makes it sound as if Kauffman himself is a computer jockey playing artificial life games rather than an Marshall scholar, MD, Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Biotech company founder, and recipient of numerous prestigious awards and fellowships.  Kauffman's resume ([...]) makes Behe look like a grad student.  Behe mixes up Kauffman's ideas with others less profound, picks out pieces out of context, and then states that \\"this aspect of complexity theory\\" requires pre-existing, already functioning systems.  Behe finishes his dismissal of one of the most interesting investigations into the origins of life with a patronizing concluding paragraph:<br /><br />\\"Complexity theory may yet make important contributions to mathematics, and it may still make modest contributions to biochemistry.  But it cannot explain the origin of the complex biochemical structures that undergird life.  It doesn't even try.\\"<br /><br />In the dynamics of polemic discourse, Behe has just \\"inoculated\\" the reader who has yet to read Kauffman against these ideas which directly challenge Behe's conclusions.  The Behe reader now may think they know something about Kauffman and his ideas and that they are unimportant instead of powerful.  Behe performs an even more egregious \\"inoculation\\" when he misquotes Daniel Dennett to make him sound like a nut-case rather than the profound rationalist and meticulous logician that he is.  Behe is a crusader for God, and he doesn't want you to open your mind to these \\"godless\\" intellectuals.<br /><br />Behe is then so bold as to declare, in his concluding chapter, that the cumulative efforts of cellular biological investigation clearly and unambiguously point to intelligent design.  He then mournfully suggests that the scientific community's failure to embrace and announce that conclusion stems from various cultural pressures.  He examines and dismisses what he claims are the main arguments against intelligent design, but he conveniently overlooks the most potent argument that is the real reason the scientific community has not accepted intelligent design:  it doesn't provide any useful knowledge.<br /><br />Intelligent Design is a way of giving up.  Behe doesn't say \\"Look, natural selection may be necessary but it isn't sufficient to explain things the way they are.  Let's open our minds to new ways of thinking.  Maybe there is a natural principle right under our noses that we have been blind to.\\".  That's what Kaufmann says, but Behe says no, don't bother to try to find a natural principle for these problems.  They are too complex to have arisen on their own.  God created them.  Even if all these systems existed \\"in the mind of God\\" before they came into creation, how did they come into creation?  What are God's physical methods?

Nothing I've ever read had such a thick storyline or plot as The City of Ember. But, it has some dragging parts in the middle, like about the main character's grandmother losing something. The City of Ember is a very interesting book to read, and I suggest it to avid readers who are sick of the Harry Potter Series or sick of waiting for some book to come out. <br /> <br />I like the mystery in the City of Ember, and I can see a very clear message from the author. Usually, some books don't have a clear purpose or message from the author because it's like some fantasy book. But The City of Ember is rare in that way. <br /> <br />The City of Ember is a kind of alien to the other books, and that's what makes the suspense. The main characters are Lind Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, two friends who are exactly opposite of each other. They solve the mysterys of their city with clues everywhere with the lights flickering....... <br /> <br />To find out what happens to Lina and Doon, read this book. It is worthwhile to read The City of Ember!	2005-10-13

It goes into too much detail in some parts about how different children learn and how the teacher can help those children.

With re-writing the book, Holt looked back at what he said previously and explained how teaching styles changed.

Let me tell you, I thought it was awesome.  Yes, there are similarities to other books and one particular movie series, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  It is very evident that the book was written by a teenager, but I think that's one things I liked about it.  I thought the writing was pretty straight forward and to the point, as well as easy to read.  Good job Paolini, keep it up.  I am currently reading the second book and enjoying it very much.  As an avid fantasy reader I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, whether it be fantasy or not.  To those of you who stress out about the small things, such as the similarities to other authors and obvious clues Eragon should be picking up on, I recommend you get out of your mom's basement and put the dungeons and dragons board away (or whatever it is you use to play the game)!

After getting to know her hard-working local sanitation workers and touring some nearby staging areas, Royte ran into trouble when asking to inspect the modern for-profit landfills. (NYC garbage often ends up in landfills in my ever-so-accepting state of Pennsylvania.) Landfills are now gigantic corporate operations where secrecy rules, as if they have something to hide from irate citizens or nosy government inspectors. I was disappointed that Royte gave up on the landfills so easily, because if she had stuck with her detective work, she could have written a powerhouse investigative report on this shifty business. Royte has better luck with following her recycled items, gaining much insight into the nature of recycling operations, from the questionable economics of citizen sorting efforts to whether or not recycling things really saves energy or raw materials. The answers to these questions will probably be more depressing than you expect.<br /><br />Royte's coverage of recycling turns out to be the most useful aspect of this book, and you may conclude that it's not all it's cracked up to be. That's because Royte shows that consumer and household waste actually makes up just a tiny percentage of what goes to landfills, and quaint small-scale efforts by individual citizens barely make a dent when large-scale commercial and industrial operations are given no reason to reduce their infinitely [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker amounts of waste. Eventually, the book narrows down its arguments to the real benefits of reducing consumption and consumerism, because in theory we won&#8217;t have to worry about disposing of waste that is never created in the first place. (A New York City sanitation official provided the telling quote that I used as the title of this review.) Unfortunately, Royte jumps around among a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K many smaller issues in refining this concept, which results in quick and spotty coverage of many important aspects of the garbage universe, while the reduce-reuse-recycle consensus is not backed up by any corroborated economics or authoritative philosophy.

It's fresh, with practical approaches that I've been applying in many communication situations.  THEY'VE WORKED! Some books make 'persuasion' feel more like 'manipulation'.  This author shows how persuading someone can be the end result of a relationship built on trust and an authentic awareness and interest in the other person.  Most importantly, there are lots of clear tools to help practice what she suggests. <br /> <br />For example, I am more aware of my attention and have gotten much better at paying attention by applying her advice.  Again, it's not about manipulating, but about really listening.  Erickson writes \\"Giving someone else your attention is a way of treating them, and yourself, with real respect.  It can't be faked.\\"  And she tells you HOW to do this better. <br /> <br />Also, there's a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K list of questions to help prepare for an important meeting or phone call.  My book naturally falls open to pages 96 and 97 because I refer to them so often.  They help me get the focus off of myself and onto what's important to the other person/people.  I feel so much more prepared and confident when I use these questions to guide my planning. <br /> <br />I could go on and on, but one other way Erickson's book has had an impact on my communication is the \\"levels of engagement\\" she describes when having a chance encounter.  She asks: Are you engaging to be polite (hearing but not listening) - Level 1.  Or, engaging to be right (I know what you're going to say, I might even finish your sentences) - Level 2.  Level 3: engaging selectively (I have a pretty good idea about how I want this chance meeting to turn out because I know what you do for a living and it relates to what I do -- there could be a good opportunity here).  Or, Level 4: engaging to learn. (I want to understand as much as possible about you in the time available and under the circumstances.  Let's enjoy this chance meeting.) She writes more about each level but they really helped me realize how I was treating these situations - at conferences, cocktail parties, airplane rides.  Engaging to learn has had a tremendous impact on relationships I've developed (and business opportunities that have resulted much more naturally, genuinely, and enjoyably). <br /> <br />It's an easy to read guide that will encourage you to connect in a more meaningful way with others and will give you practical ways to make your communication more effective. <br />	2005-10-13

While balanced perspectives are available to those proficient enough to wade through the stormy seas of coverage, much of the reporting obsesses on the drawbacks and any failed efforts of the US military and its allies.  <br /> It is a very good thing that such myriad media did not exist in 1776.  In David McCullough's engaging rendering of America's birth, he exposes the many setbacks, missteps, defeats, desertions, and poorly planned or executed campaigns that plagued the nascent nation's ragged army. Had CNN existed in those days, a colonial version of Judy Woodruff could regularly regale viewers with leading statements such as \\"more and more of General Washington's supporters are growing disillusioned with his poor management and indeciveness.\\"   An 18th century Al Franken could have gone on Air America (a.k.a. Err America) and maligned the American military for declaring war on a sovereign country that posed it no threat.  And an equally vacuous, previous incarnation of Arianna Huffington would have had reason to have elite loyalists malign Washington and company on a reality-blurring blog had such technology been around during the Revolution. <br /> McCullough does document the miscalculations America's inexperienced military committed as well as list the many triumphs of the established and potent British forces.  He expounds upon the doubts many of Washington's contemporaries privately and sometimes publicly expressed.  Before the sober judgment of history could objectively evaluate the transfiguring legacy of Washington's accomplishments, the uncertainty of the present did give jusifiable cause to those who questioned his wisdom and strategy.   The eventual success of the ragtag colonial army-despite massive desertions-and the enduring American experiment prove the mastery of Washington's prowess and show why his name has become synonymous with [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kness. The Father of his Country would not have earned his rightful place in history had he failed to remain steadfast when the going got tough or adroitly recovered from the inevitable mistakes that befall all battlefield planning. <br /> \\"1776\\" fleshes out a timeless story and shows that there were many difficulties and heartaches that preceded the ultimate victory.  It also serves as a good inspiration for the ongoing liberation of Iraq.  Had the clichs of \\"quagmire\\" and \\"another Vietnam\\" existed in the 1700's no doubt the ancestors of today's antiwar ilk would have routinely invoked them.  As this readable work clearly spells out, war is a messy proposition where the best laid plans can and do go astray, but setbacks can never excuse retreat.  A far stronger case could have been made for abandoning the mission in 1776 than modern day Iraq.  Years from now both will stand as American military victories, and the bumps along the road to success will be reduced to historic footnotes.  <br />	2005-10-13

I think he does the public a service by making it so easy to read. Unfortunately, this accessibility is largely gained at the expense of a certain philosophical elegance, if you will. For example, in some contexts he'll use the word \\"universe\\" as meaning physical spacetime, and in other contexts he'll use it to mean \\"everything that exists, including God.\\" Initially, he tells you when he's changing his meaning, but then he later doesn't.<br /><br />In short, if you are used to the clarity and rigorous approach used by many philosophical authors (e.g., Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, etc.), then you may find Ward's approach a bit less deductive (or even inductive). He is mostly concerned with rebutting Dawkins and Atkins than actually developing an original philosophy.<br /><br />For instance, he develops many interesting metaphysical ideas (for example, human free will is not incompatible with God's omniscience, since God could conceivably know of every *possible universe* while the future of the *actual universe* was indetermined), but he doesn't lay down a rigorous metaphysical system. I suppose one reason he does this is because he wants to appeal to a wide crowd of religious people who have their own doctrines, and they might feel alienated if Ward was to make truth claims beyond what is universally accepted about how the universe works.<br /><br />Not clearly a good thing, he often waxes lyrical in poetic tangents that don't do much to help his case, except maybe emotionally or aesthetically. Though, I suppose if intuition and aesthetics are any basis for concluding something about reality, then these tangents aren't entirely wasteful. Oh, and for some reason he frequently employs awkward transitional adverbs to begin sentences like, \\"In fact, of course, it is true that...,\\" which I found distracting.<br /><br />I think this book's [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest success is in highlighting the grave limitations of natural selection *alone* to explain intelligent life. He effectively proves that the idea of life existing for the propagation of genes (Cf. Dawkins, \\"The Selfish Gene\\") is completely ludicrous (it would be, he points out, like suggesting that the cake exists for the propagation of the recipe; but the recipe does not have intention, and neither does DNA!). Again, these are not couched in philosophical language, and, if you want a more rigorous approach that supports Ward's position, I recommend you see any of John Searle's essays or books about consciousness.ighlighting the grave limitations of natural selection *alone* to explain intelligent life.

Hippolyte, who refuses to welcome any 20th century luxury, is obsessed with finding a set of islands with a dark, muddled history. The first part of the book focuses on his search for the islands. <br /> <br />His adventures are funded by a publisher taking a chance, and are later to be reviewed by a straight-laced editor without any sympathy towards Hippolyte's shortcomings.  The second half of the book focuses on proving the first half of the book was real.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book suffers from an inconsistent voice.  Even Hippolyte changes from an obsessive compulsive man capapble of managing his life as an adult to an erratic, boy-like bohemian dead set on writing a story about... his under-developed adventure. <br /> <br />As a result, we learn that while Hippolyte is an excellent adventurer, he is a horrible writer.  And the second half of the book makes the reader put up with Hippolyte's disrespect of anything normal.  If Hippolyte wasn't so darn strange, none of the problems encountered after his trip would have surfaced, and you can't help but want to reach in and slap him sometimes. I found reading through the various documents - letters, emails, chapters by Hippolyte himself - to be tedious and unrewarding.   <br /> <br />The end of the book does a pretty nice job of wrapping up the story, and the aftertaste of the book sits nice on the bookshelf.  Unfortunately, there is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K sense of \\"so what\\" throughout the book, as the reader has to wait for the nice bits of Hodgson's writing to surface.   <br /> <br />Filled with magical moments of beautiful prose, and unforunate insertions of ugly facts, the book is fighting with itself to either be a historical document or a rich novel.  If you are looking for a quirky mix of fact and fiction - this is it.	2005-10-13

Eccentricity was often simply the Ordinary carried to a high degree of pictorial perfection, Sitwell claims, and thus we get a gifted glimpse of the usually-overlooked obvious.<br /><br />Of course, there is so much material to work with, it is a wonder the book isn't multi-volumed! Originally published in 1933, it retains much of its vitality and levity despite being two generations (at least) behind the times. Sitwell caught the character of the English Eccentric at a time just before the wholesale decline of Empire, and thus the character portrayed here is a 'standard' one.<br /><br />'Eccentricity exists particularly in the English, and partly, I think, because of that peculiar and satisfactory knowledge of infallibility that is the hallmark and birthright of the British nation.'<br /><br />In the relating of small tales and glimpses of life, Sitwell takes us through a history of language usage and abusage, cultural niceties gone awry, personal proclivities taken to extremes, historical remembrances remembered a bit incorrectly, all the while maintaining a strong British 'we know just what we're doing, thank you, and we're doing it quite correctly' attitude.<br /><br />We find hermits, both ancient and ornamental (the distinction between the two of course being a relative flash that one would think inimical to the hermit-age); quacks and alchemists, some members of the sporting set (we learn of one who, in an attempt to scare the hiccups out of himself, set fire to his nightshirt--of course he was still in it--and was satisfied despite the burns that his hiccups had been vanquished), various other sorts and sets in the land.<br /><br />Perhaps the most valuable lesson to be learned from this book would the Of the Benefits of Posthumous Fame. Using Milton as the first example, Sitwell proceeds to demonstrate just how this posthumous fame (for the man who sold Paradise Lost for the meagre sum of £20) can be a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K boon to all concerned, particularly those who have the foresight to collect locks of hair or write poetry about rummaging through the bone-remains of the dead poet. Of course, there followed in short order a detailed (yet anonymous) description of why the poet could not have actually handled the bones of the poet, not least of which being that as the grave said 1653, and Milton was not in fact buried until 1674, et cetera; thus begins an active correspondence of attempting to prove or disprove in fashion why Milton was not bodily handled.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly English treatment; like her eccentrics, Sitwell's style of writing is likewise gloriously eccentric. Much will be missed on the first reading, and again the second; by the third reading (should you be so eccentric as to persevere through to such) you will either be so charmed by the writing that you will carry this book around, quoting passages that need context to be understood (and thus be ordained into a minor order of eccentricity yourself) or, you will give the book away to the most tedious of your friends, hoping that the friend will take the hint.<br /><br />The choice is yours.emonstrate just how this posthumous fame (for the man who sold Paradise Lost for the meagre sum of 20) can be a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K boon to all concerned, particularly those who have the foresight to collect locks of hair or write poetry about rummaging through the bone-remains of the dead poet.

See, this is due to the fact that Count Leo had at least two phases in his brilliant career as a writer. In the most important one, he revealed himself as a master craftsman of the Verbe, an acute and profound vivisector of the human soul, like in \\"Anna Karenina\\", \\"War and Peace\\", \\"Hadji Murad\\" and his best tales. In a late phase, Tolstoy transformed himself into a preacher, a proponent of rural lifestyles -which is fine if it does not contain the condemnation of other lifestyles. Even worse, he turned into a moralist, preaching to the world the way everybody should conduct their affairs, and into a moral celebrity.  <br /> <br />Bat anyway some of his tales are really good, including \\"Ivan the  Fool\\", which nonetheless lets the reader see very clearly the cheap philosophy behind it. In my opinion, the best tales in this collection are \\"Polikushka\\", a masterpiece of crude and rude Naturalism, vivid and sad; \\"Albert the Musician\\", a sadness of alcoholic delirium-tremens; \\"Forty years\\", the story of Divine punishment; and \\"The Three Questions\\", about moral learning. <br /> <br />The strange characteristics of Russian literature shine through in this volume: mysticism, spiritual torment, poverty and harsh weather abound in the work of this [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K author.	2005-10-13

Kirkpatrick, former Ambassador to the United Nations under Ronald Reagan, is the author of one of the three most famous essays in the history of American foreign policy, \\"Dictatorships and Double Standards,\\" Commentary (November 1979)--the other two being George F. Kennan's call for \\"containment\\" of the Soviet Union and The End of History by Francis Fukuyama.  In it she argued that it was incumbent on the United States to differentiate between authoritarian regimes and totalitarian regimes.  Authoritarian regimes she argued, like Iran and Nicaragua, though they obviously did not meet our preferred standards of democratization, were fundamentally just harsh, but traditional, governments of countries which had known no other type of government and were perhaps not yet ready for democracy :<br /><br />  \\"Traditional autocrats leave in place existing allocations of wealth, power, status, and other<br /><br />  resources, which in most traditional societies favor an affluent few and maintain masses in poverty.<br /><br />  But they worship traditional gods and observe traditional taboos.  They do not disturb the habitual<br /><br />  rhythms of work and leisure, habitual places of residence, habitual patterns of family and personal<br /><br />  relations.\\"<br /><br />Essentially, the autocracies protect their own power and wealth, but leave most other aspects of life relatively untouched.  As the name implies, they are more concerned with who in society will wield authority, i.e. themselves, than with imposing any particular ideology.  Because this is the case, they in fact preserve many of the institutions upon which democracy can later be built, whether the Church or corporations or other civic organizations.<br /><br />Totalitarian regimes, on the other hand, as the name implies, seek to totally reinvent and control every aspect of society.  This requires them to so violate the existing institutions as to render the society nearly incapable of evolving into a democracy.<br /><br />These fundamental differences between the two types of regimes suggest important reasons that we should be more rigorous in our approach to the one than the other.  Because authoritarian regimes are less oppressive of their citizens and are more amenable to democracy they are more susceptible to pressure from without, but at the same time, particularly when Kirkpatrick was writing, at the very nadir of the Cold War, it was especially dangerous to destabilize these generally friendly regimes, particularly in light of the fact that they could be expected, over a period of years, to gradually transform themselves into more democratic societies.<br /><br />Meanwhile, authoritarian regimes, like Cuba and Vietnam, though they tend to cast their ideology in the language of progressive democracy, which makes them seem somehow more akin to the U.S., in reality are much more oppressive of their people and, because they destroy traditional institutions, tend to create such devastation that it is extremely difficult for external pressure to aid the rise of democracy.  They are both worse for their people in the short run and more likely to endure in the long run.<br /><br />This leaves America in a difficult position.  Neither type of government vindicates our ideals of liberal democracy.  We would of course like to see both become more democratic.  But the regimes we can most easily change are the less offensive ones, and ones that are likely to be our de facto allies.  Those regimes which truly brutalize their populations, and which at that time were generally allied with our enemy, the Soviet Union, tend not to be easily pressured.<br /><br />Further complicating matters is the fact that in countries with authoritarian regimes, there tend to be reasonably well-organized and very well supplied guerrilla movements.  This was particularly true when the Soviet Union and the rest of the Warsaw Pact nations existed and stood ready to support them.  Totalitarian nations, with their much more restrictive internal controls, and with the U.S. showing no interest in supplying indigenous rebellions, tended to be relatively free of organized civil unrest.<br /><br />All of these factors combined in the late 1970's to bring about the bizarre and tragic situation whereby the government of Jimmy Carter basically helped to topple the Somoza government in Nicaragua and the Shah in Iran.  In effect, this eliminated two friendly governments in important strategic locations, governments which while by no means ideal were hardly the two worst human rights offenders even in their own regions.  In the ultimate perversity, it seemed that they were actually targeted by the Carter Administration precisely because they were so closely associated with the United States.  Allies were destroyed, an action made possible because they were not as repressive as other regimes, and replaced by radical totalitarian regimes allied with the Soviet Union, with whom we were at war.<br /><br />Looked at in the abstract like this, the Carter policy seems nearly suicidal.  But Jeane Kirkpatrick traced it to a dangerous faith in Rationalism, as opposed to reliance on Realism, as the basis of foreign policy.  The important thing to note here is that the critique of Rationalism that she offers is very similar to the general conservative critique of modern day liberalism.  The Left has an almost alchemical notion of mankind, believing that any transmutation that they can arrive at rationally can be then be engineered socially.  Able to imagine a utopian world in which Marxist guerilla leaders turn a illiterate, Third World, agrarian, nation into a liberal, egalitarian democracy (moreover, one that would be unfettered by such hoary institutions as the Church, the aristocracy, the military, etc.), they assume such an apotheosis to be imminent.<br /><br />What Kirkpatrick was calling for was a foreign policy grounded in Realism.  Hard experience has demonstrated time and again that revolutionaries who set out to completely transform a society end up imposing an even [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker tyranny than the one they replace.  Even more troublesome, they practically never fade away or evolve into democracies (at least they hadn't to that point--the collapse of Eastern European Communism offers a difficult counter argument), they are likely to endure until they in turn are overthrown by conquest from without or violent counterrevolution from within.  For these reasons, we are frequently, if not always, better off opting for the devil we know, the kind of traditional autocratic regimes which, though not democratic, at least offer stability and domestic order, tend to be fairly trustworthy allies, and frequently evolve into democracies.  Kirkpatrick's theory was ultimately vindicated at least in this regard as this was basically the process which occurred in places like Spain, the Philippines, South Africa, Chile, and so on.<br /><br />In fact, the current case of Russia provides a really difficult test of some the implications of theory.  The complete failure of capitalism and democratic institutions to establish themselves in post-Soviet Russia begs the question of whether a brief period of fascist rule there might not have a salutary effect.  First, it would allow central authorities to reestablish the rule of law, both by curbing crime and corruption and by restoring the notion of property rights.  This sort of functioning legal system it now seems fair to say  is an absolutely imperative precursor of capitalism and democracy.  Second, it would provide a period of relative physical security and cultural freedom during which civic institutions could be revitalized--the Church, political parties, corporations, the military, law enforcement, the judiciary, etc.  Difficult as the prospect may be for us to accept, it may well be the case that a healthy Russian democracy will only flower in the wake of a period of authoritarian rule.  This is notto suggest that we should aid Vladimir Putin in oppressing his own people or even that we should turn a blind eye, it is merely to suggest that it might be in our own best interests and ultimately those of the Russian people to allow him some latitude to restore order to that badly disordered nation, even if in so doing he sometimes offends our delicate democratic sensibilities.<br /><br />Other essays in this collection range over a surprisingly wide field, including some perceptive observations on American domestic politics.  The span of years and topics covered means that they don't necessarily fit together into a unified whole, but the dichotomy between reason and realism recurs often enough that they do present a coherent argument in the end.  Thus, in an essay on the failure of the efforts to reform the political parties, she's essentially arguing that the reformers bought into an illusion that they could make the parties adhere to abstract principles, simply because they could imagine this happening.<br /><br />Similarly, in discussing the failure of the New Right to capture either the presidency or the Republican Party nomination in 1976, as theorists like Kevin Phillips, Pat Buchanan, William Rusher, and others expected they would, she points out that their theories were based on a faith that would have required a genuine transformation in the American electorate.  This faith, as the only incremental successes of even Ronald Reagan and the Republican Congress of '94 have demonstrated, was rather misguided.  It may be true--I hope to God it is--that people are reasonably conservative at their core, but it is surely no coincidence that for the past seventy years they have consistently elected candidates who have promised them ever [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker government benefits.  While reason can build a case for why that should, even why it must, change, realism requires one to note the stubborn fact.<br /><br />Today these essays are probably little more than a footnote to the history of the Cold War.  But they among the more interesting footnotes.  The fact that Kirkpatrick became a major player in the administration the defeated Communism and won the Cold War, the degree to which her ideas were turned into official U. S. policy, and the prophetic quality of much that she wrote, makes them well worth your while.nstrated time and again that revolutionaries who set out to completely transform a society end up imposing an even [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker tyranny than the one they replace.

Thus, in an essay on the failure of the efforts to reform the political parties, she's essentially arguing that the reformers bought into an illusion that they could make the parties adhere to abstract principles, simply because they could imagine this happening. <br /> <br />Similarly, in discussing the failure of the New Right to capture either the presidency or the Republican Party nomination in 1976, as theorists like Kevin Phillips, Pat Buchanan, William Rusher, and others expected they would, she points out that their theories were based on a faith that would have required a genuine transformation in the American electorate.  This faith, as the only incremental successes of even Ronald Reagan and the Republican Congress of '94 have demonstrated, was rather misguided.  It may be true--I hope to God it is--that people are reasonably conservative at their core, but it is surely no coincidence that for the past seventy years they have consistently elected candidates who have promised them ever [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker government benefits.  While reason can build a case for why that should, even why it must, change, realism requires one to note the stubborn fact. <br /> <br />Today these essays are probably little more thana footnote to the history of the Cold War.  But they among the more interesting footnotes.  The fact that Kirkpatrick became a major player in the administration the defeated Communism and won the Cold War, the degree to which her ideas were turned into official U. S. policy, and the prophetic quality of much that she wrote, makes them well worth your while.	2005-10-13

In this work, Ignatieff explores the idea of need and its consequences for how we think about the political and social organization of our societies.  Ignatieff's point of departure is the fact that the modern welfare states provide, as a matter of right, support for a few narrowly defined physical needs but that this leaves a large range of important needs untouched.  Satisfaction of these needs has left not only other important needs unsatisfied but has resulted in an erosion of social solidarity essential to certain aspects of needs.  Ignatieff sets out to explore historic conceptions of need and how they relate to influential political and economic theories.  Having defined the problem, Ignatieff proceeds to a series of interesting essays examining conceptions of need and various analyses of society.  These include a sensitive reading of King Lear as a study of natural versus social man, a relevant analysis of Augustine, and particularly good study of the implications of Hume's philosophy using Hume's death as it fulcrum, and a nice comparison of Adam Smith and Rousseau.  Ignatieff demonstrates that conceptions of need are variable, often contradictory, and that different conceptions have markedly different consdequences for how we think society should be organized.  These sections are insightful and Ignatieff is a very good and often eloquent writer.  The deficiency of this book is that having exposed these difficulties, Ignatieff makes no effort to show a way forward except to say that we need to develop a \\"language of needs.\\"  Presumably, this means some kind of common vocabulary that would allow us to address the problems of defining and addressing many human needs.  Aside from the ambiguity of his statements, he makes no effort to suggest how such a vocabulary could be constructed.  What kind of definitions could be used?  Is there a typology of needs possible?  Is there a hierarchy of needs?  How does this impact on thinking about organizing society.  These are difficult questions but having set the stage for addressing these issues, Ignatieff abruptly rings down the curtain.possible?  Is there a hierarchy of needs?

I purchased this book to brush up on speed training and the latest techniques so I could train my son and some soccer teamates.  I have done speed training myself years ago and was familiar with the methods.  This book cuts out the fluff and tells you exactly what to do and why. The author does a good job of explaining how to apply the training to younger athletes and at what age each technique is appropriate.  The step by step training course outlined is terrific.  My only complaint is that not enough emphasis is put on sprintng technique/posture and how to improve it.  My experience has been that poor technique/posture is often the biggest problem for young athletes and luckily I already knew quite a bit about technique. A few more photos and details on proper sprinting technique would really help.  Overall, the book is very good and we are achieving [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K results using the workouts.	2005-10-13

I found this volume to be extremely interesting, even fascinating at times.  It focuses upon the writing of Winston Churchill's epic \\"The Second World War,\\" whose six volumes were a major publishing event around the world, and eventually earned Churchill a Nobel Prize for literature. It is really several different books in one. <br /> <br />    First, much like Ashley's \\"Churchill as Historian,\\" the author discusses the actual mechanics of writing so massive a project when Churchill had plenty of other things to keep him busy.  The \\"syndicate\\" of experts who assisted him, including even the Parliamentary Cabinet Office, is analyzed in [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K detail. According to the author, the \\"three D's\\" were the core of Churchill's method.  That is, first he had set in type the key documents which he had collected during his wartime service as Prime Minister. Then he tied the documents together with dictated reminiscenses.  Finally, the third \\"D\\" consisted of a very large number of drafts whereby the documents were edited down and the connecting narrative supplemented with WC's own recollections or papers drafted by syndicate members. Ironically, it is Churchill's heavy reliance upon documents that at once has yielded much praise from other historical researchers (since otherwise they would not have been made public for as much as 50 years after the war's conclusion),but also generated negative reactions from lay readers, especially in the U.S. <br /> <br />     Next, the really interesting issues are tackled.  For example, how candid and accurate was WC regarding his actions during the war?  The author extremely well documents how WC would edit documents, or even modify them, in order to (not surprisingly) put himself in the best historical light.  Also, he was duty bound not to reveal the existence of \\"Ultra,\\" which was the designation for breaking the German code during the war. Given the fact that in the postwar period, others were also writing books (e.g., Ike with his \\"Crusade in Europe\\" and Sherwood's \\"Roosevelt and Hopkins\\"), WC would frequently modify his drafts in order to obviate any possible taint regarding his decisions and actions while PM in a stab at vindication.  One good example was the dispute that arose over whether WC had favored or retarded the \\"Overlord\\" invasion of France in 1944. Churchill also faced the practical constraints of the Cold War being on-going and also acting as head of the Conservative Party and ultimately PM for a second time.  These factors too influenced how he structured the text. <br /> <br />     Of course a most intriguing question is did WC really write the work given the extensive assistance he received?  The author suggests a useful analogy: WC was like a master chef at a large restaurant who designs and directs the menu, while others do much of the actual food preparation.  He also likens it to a group project in science, where a number of folks collaborate on a paper which is attributed to the lead author. Clearly, it is Churchill's book even though he did not write all of it himself--but he reviewed every sentence and corrected or struck out that with which he disagreed.  <br /> <br />    Finally, in a most interesting discussion, the author recounts the arguments that arose during the 1955-1965 period as other historians, military figures, and the leaders of other countries (such as De Gaulle) took aim on Churchill's analysis.  Not quite as challenging as fighting Hitler, but still quite a nice war of its own.  The author, Professor of International History at Cambridge, has done just a superior job.  Be warned, it is a long book (over 600 pages) and the Penguin edition is set in very small type.  But the rewards of the book more than compensate for these problems, especially for those of us interested in Churchill. The stream of Churchill volumes continues unabated and has even increased recently--but this book should be singled out for the unique perspective it affords us on \\"the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K man.\\"	2005-10-13

US	46899882	R311ZEODIPOBV6	0671458183	851439417	Monsignor Quixote	Books	5	7	9	N	N	PEOPLE OF FAITH	This is one of the funniest and cleverest novels I have ever read. It is also one of the deepest. Behind the clever adaptation of the Don Quixote story to a context in post-Franco Spain there is a dance of ideas, much as Shaw's plays are a dance of ideas, and the questions dealt with are the biggest and most fundamental that we all have to deal with.<br /><br />An innocent and un-intellectual Catholic priest sets out on a holiday with a communist politician, and their discussions, always friendly and courteous and [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kly assisted by wine, centre on their respective faiths. The communist faith is much the more straightforward - the ex-mayor, defeated at a recent election, finds the general outlook of Marx congenial, he finds that doubt shackles freedom of action, and that's about as far as his introspection goes. Catholicism is about bigger issues altogether, such as do we go to heaven or to hell for all eternity, and the concepts involved, for someone who really thinks about them honestly, are sufficient to unseat anyone's mind. There is no real alternative to thinking about them, so in the interests of peace of mind what people do is to think about them not honestly but either ingenuously or disingenuously. Graham Greene, like Muriel Spark, was a convert to Catholicism, and like Dame Muriel his treatment of it in his writing is wry and ironic. What he really `believed' is not quite clear and I'm sure not meant to be. Indeed he even casts some doubt around the question of what `belief' actually consists of, and rightly so in my own view. At one point Father Quixote admits that a certain doctrine is one that he believes out of obedience, an admirable attitude for traditionalist believers whether Catholic or communist - you believe x because you're supposed to believe it and you'll be in trouble if you don't. Greene quite obviously sees that Catholic doctrine evolved as a book of rules to keep people under control. What started as religious and ethical teaching developed rapidly into thought-enforcement and thought-policing, but the matter goes even deeper - behind it all there is supposed to be a God whose word the ecclesiastical power-structure dispenses, and this God is not, like Marx, someone who certainly exists but only a hypothesis. How much further Greene wishes us to pursue this line of thought I'm not clear, but for me two considerations follow - firstly what is supposed to be God's word is actually a human construct foisted on the hypothetical God, something that to me seems outright blasphemy; and in the second place we have a clearer idea these days what the Creator has created, and such a Creator is not likely to bear much resemblance to Jehovah in the scriptures having to assert his authority against Baal, Dagon etc at intervals. Indeed if there is one crumb of comfort in the contemplation of such a Creator it's likely to be that he will take little or no notice of our insolence in presuming to speak for his intentions.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book Greene says something to the effect that in the absence of certain knowledge one goes for the next best thing. For him this is `faith', for me it's probability, as best I can assess that. Greene is able, as I am not, to find a sense of `believing' that takes in the soul as well as the mind. When I say that I believe something I mean that it seems to me true or probable, and considerations that bring me spiritual comfort are unrelated to belief in this sense entirely. Greene seems not to go so far, but I venture to think that he's nearer to my way of seeing things than to `faith' in the conventional sense. What is completely unmistakable is the irony with which he observes the way that the devout have of finding support in the scriptures and in philosophy built on them for convenient viewpoints and courses of action.<br /><br />The book is not so much about the rival ideas, nor even so much about what people do with these as about what the ideas do with peoplewho for some reason adhere to them, as if the ideas had taken on a higher life of their own, dominating and controlling the very people who create them and without whom they could never exist. This may indeed be what we call divine in them. What is divine in a more earthly sense about this book is the humour and ingenuity of it all.

All in all I found this book to be a compelling read.  There is good character development, a solid plot and good dialog.  Stephen, the main character in the story becomes \\"obsessed\\" with an object.  As the story progresses one can see how a person can become obsessed with something and go to [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K lengths to obtain it even nearly to the point of going beyond rational thinking.   I believe the author succeeds in getting this point across.  The antagonist (Rolf) is cold and calculating with a very sinister overtone which is carried thru to the end.  However there are a some glitches in the story like a few inconsistencies (when Stephen pulls a knife out of his sock) and a few other areas when the author skips over important details.  And, to be honest the premise is a bit concocted. One has to suspend belief a bit that a mother and son, separated at birth for nearly 30+ years just happen to live only 20 miles from one another  and that her byline in a newspaper just happens to be read by her son (but he doesn't know he's her son).   But, beyond these drawbacks the story I felt was solid.  The flashbacks to the Nazi concentration camps of WWII were lurid and wholly believable and connected the story well.  The story has a nice little plot twist at the end.  Even with the noted drawbacks I found the book very readable.	2005-10-13

As a bonus, King recommends my standby reference on writing, \\"Elements of Style,\\" by William Strunk Jr. & E.B. White.<br /><br />Leave it to King, The Master, to write this semi-autobiographical expose on authorship craft in a more intriguingly unique organizational setup than anyone else could conjure or dare. Leave it to Him to force (or else) a (sort of) \\"how to\\" book into mesmerizing entertainment; to step into the job with a horrific grab about a kid suffering ear drum puncture; and to coerce an anomaly of styles and content to coalesce into a gestalt of genius which WORKS, period.<br /><br />How can a book on writing be riveting?? Read it and see.<br /><br />King includes only those riveting parts of his personal history which have contributed to his writing career. He includes only the necessary elements to \\"teach\\" how to spark and stir creative fires. He includes only the necessary keys to his success (amazingly, he does know what those keys are).<br /><br />I was impressed with King's exposure of his method of writing from a SITUATION rather than from a precise PLOT outline; I still find myself chewing on that daring technique (though I do still appreciate a strongly plotted story).<br /><br />I was interested in his examples of bad and good prose, and agree with his praise of other works, though I reserve judgment on a few of his criticisms, and have developed techniques to take breaks whenever I need them without permanently losing a creative flow, which I can renew at almost any point if I can set up the right conditions.  (When I break through with as many Number One Best Sellers as Mr. King has, maybe my opinion on writing will be as viable as his.)<br /><br />King has many times earned the right to have an opinion on writing and to offer it for sale. Yet, he has approached this project with genuine humility, which is, to me, endearing (sorry about the sentimental slip, Oh Master of Horror).<br /><br />What do I admire most about this author, which is evident in this book? I absolutely enjoy his regenerating honesty, his uncanny originality, and his demand of himself to toss reader boredom into a black hole and perform, within his printed words, 24/7 without fail. Also love the way he sincerely and humbly exposes his respect for his wife.<br />Given what this man has endured and accomplished in his life, he's earned the best type of REST available to a human being, and I don't mean the big \\"D.\\" He deserves to be quite proud of himself. He deserves to have his thumbs permanently posed in the sides of a vest, to sit back and smile at his trail of effort and result.<br /><br />What a gift that he would attempt in earnest to share his secrets of writing success. And his uncanny self-awareness allowed him to share clearly what those secrets are, in this valuable gift for the youngest as well as the most seasoned of writers. This I say as a 2 decades professional writer and previous English and creative writing teacher who has published various articles and finished and polished 8 fiction manuscripts and has another 8 + book-length works in progress.  I'm not EVEN near King's level in the marketplace (yet), but I am a highly productive creative spirit who knows how to maintain, ride, and design the flow.<br /><br />There's always more than one way to approach any creative endeavor, and my approach to writing is similar to King's in some ways, somewhat different in other ways (I can only compare, of course, to the content offered in this book).  This insight to King's techniques exposes what works for him and what could work for other, though of course not all creative spirits.  Young writers should allow themselves leeway in deciding how to tap and work with their talents.  Creativity should be allowed to flourish, even when establishing a personal method on how to use that force, and sometimes it's necessary to forge a unique path diverging from even the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest masters.  When I was teaching creative writing in the public school systems, I asked my students to at least try some of the established methods of writing prior to setting any of them aside to break away from them.<br /><br />Another [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book which exposes a writer's path and techniques (through a novel rather than through a unique how to book) is THE NOVEL by James A. Michener.  See my review.<br /><br />What I believe On Writing has exposed better than many writing \\"how to\\" books is tapping into the Right Brain.  As I've observed the styles of many authors of novels, they each seem to be almost \\"designed\\" by DNA to work in different precise balances of Right/Left Brain.  The Left Brain wants steps, plots, outlines, plans and structure to be elaborately perfect prior to that leap into the ozone.  The pure Right Brain wants only the chaos of riding a storm of the absolute unknown, describing it as it explodes into the presence of present time, constantly changing, churning.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, telling a fledgling writer how to do it is, for me, a frightening extension of my uniqueness, because I would not ever want to hamper the growth of a maverick creative source needing by its design to walk a path not taught by any master before him.  Possibly every \\"how to\\" book should carry a warning.<br /><br />This one enters the effort in fairness, with humility and honesty, and does not say or imply, \\"This is THE only way to write.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Stephen, for sharing your personal and professional views on writing, which expose your adept use of both sides of the brain, highlighting your ability to slip into the quirks of the Right side in intriguingly clear ways.  Not all writers can explain how that slip into the ozone happens.  Great books have been produced with various balances of Left & Right.

When I was teaching creative writing in the public school systems, I asked my students to at least try some of the established methods of writing prior to setting any of them aside to break away from them.    Another [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book which exposes a writer's path and techniques (through a novel rather than through a unique how to book) is THE NOVEL by James A. Michener.  See my review.    What I believe On Writing has exposed better than many writing \\"how to\\" books is tapping into the Right Brain.  As I've observed the styles of many authors of novels, they each seem to be almost \\"designed\\" by DNA to work in different precise balances of Right/Left Brain.  The Left Brain wants steps, plots, outlines, plans and structure to be elaborately perfect prior to that leap into the ozone.  The pure Right Brain wants only the chaos of riding a storm of the absolute unknown, describing it as it explodes into the presence of present time, constantly changing, churning.    Bottom line, though, telling a fledgling writer how to do it is, for me, a frightening extension of my uniqueness, because I would not ever want to hamper the growth of a maverick creative source needing by its design to walk a path not taught by any master before him.  Possibly every \\"how to\\" book should carry a warning.    This one enters the effort in fairness, with humility and honesty, and does not say or imply, \\"This is THE only way to write.\\"    Thank you, Stephen, for sharing your personal and professional views on writing, which expose your adept use of both sides of the brain, highlighting your ability to slip into the quirks of the Right side in intriguingly clear ways.  Not all writers can explain how that slip into the ozone happens.  Great books have been produced with various balances of Left & Right.  I love riding the Right, but every time I get totally off the Left it scares the shzzt out of me.With Sincere Respect,   Linda G. Shelnutt	2005-10-13

I had worried that by book three the brilliant Dave Putnam would have run out of steam in his Gamekeeper Series.  I needn't have feared as 10 Downing Street continues with the English Commonwealth controlling most of the Earth and a communist conspiracy existing which builds toward  a massive World War II.  It is more than just capitalism against communism and Putnam reveals he can just as handily explore different economic systems as he has done so beautifully in dealing with politics, war, working with animals, and especially religion.  The alternate world series continues with the addition of new characters and making excellent use of old ones from the first two books.  Winston Churchill again reigns supreme, at least for a while as this book covers a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K number of years.  More time is spent with the most  interesting Albert Einstein.  You find Dwight D. Eisenhower, Rommel, and George Patton as well.  Historical figures are dealt with in a way that will convince the reader that the author knows his history. The fictional ones are as real and alive as any you'll find in the very best of novels. He also doesn't make the mistake of bringing in characters that could not have been born after history took a major twist in the 1890's.  The work is brilliant, there are twists and surprises and even the sometimes too long technical descriptions are interesting.  The author also knows how to tell decent love stories and to treat women as human beings.  Toward the end there is a touch of Asimov and Clement, however I don't want to be a spoiler. What I like best is that unlike Turtledove and some other science fiction authors, Putnam isn't afraid to make religion and the fact that God exists as a vital part of his universe as it is in our real universe.  As a Christian I did not agree with all the views expressed, but I was not offended as the three books have the feel of being written with love.   The best  news is that a 4th book follows and I will order it just as soonas I post this review.  Dave Putnam's novels deserve to be considered classics.	2005-10-13

Not only is this book poorly written (states and restates the obvious), but it is geared for those seeking LDRs--namely, overseas (as another reviewer wrote).

Quick and good overview of what you need to know about several topics. <br /> <br />On to the specifics of this book. You get a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K outline of what you can do with JBoss including some good introductory info on Java EE in general. Some will find the lack of detail irritating but its [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K for a quick overview of how the stuff is done 'in the real world'. For example in Chapter 3 aobut creating a 'real application' the topic of XDoclet is discussed but not in [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K detail (Norman Richards has a huge 350+ page book on XDoclet) leaving the (sometimes ardious) task of getting XDoclet working with ant as an exercise to the reader. <br /> <br />The authors do a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K job of writing in an informal conversational way without being campy. <br /> <br />Specific Content: <br />1) Installing JBoss - everything you want to know about getting JBoss up and running. Any deficencies here are made up for in Chapter 9 on rolling out jboss. <br /> <br />2) Deploying Apps - the stuff you need to know about how to deploy, talks about auto-deploy and how to do exploded deployments. <br /> <br />3) Creating the complete app - I liked this chapter but I susspect that newbies will find the XDoclet stuff confusing. XDoclet is [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K and works like a champ but many people will wonder what is going on if they don't have previous XDoclet expierence. <br /> <br />4) Connecting to a real db - good stuff, esp liked the bit on monitoring. Lots of folks new to Java EE don't get that whole monitoring thing and this book talks about it a lot (in most chapters). <br /> <br />5) Secutiry - all you need to know to get started with secutring in JBoss, using LDAP & hashed passwords are covered which a lot of preliminary discussions seem to leave out. <br /> <br />6) Logging - welcome to the world of Log4J which should be really simple but somehow required lots of pages in lots of books to document. This chapter has what you need to know about to get logs going with JBoss. You are using remote debugging from your IDE though to debug your apps though aren't you? <br /> <br />7) Configuring Persistence - good quick over view to CMP and getting the CMP engine to manage your schema. <br /> <br />8) Managing and Monitoring JBoss - a whole chapter on how to manage JBoss. Lots of good info here. <br /> <br />9) Rolling out JBoss - all the stuff you might forget to do in turning on a production version of JBoss. All about security and closing the holes that you might not think to close (like the class download service). <br /> <br />Over all a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book and worth the $.	2005-10-13

This is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book! I believe makeup should be fun, and enhance your natural beauty.  It should be something nice that you do for yourself, like reading a good book in a candle lit bubble bath, taking care of your skin on a daily basis, or buying yourself fresh flowers. It should be an extension of who you are, not make you into another person; makeup should perk you up, not make you up.  Robert Jones has taken the mystery out of makeup, and made it simple and accessible for everyone.  This book includes fabulous pictures of REAL women of all ages and ethinic backgrounds (only a few of whom are professional models) in before-and-after makeup transformations.  It also includes a glossery of cosmetic terms; an awesome section on product knowledge that covers foudation, concealer, powder, eyebrow, eyeshadow, mascara, eyliner, and lipstick; a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K section on cosmetic tools; an absolutely wonderful section on chosing the right foundations and colors for YOU; and detailed instructions on how to apply everything!  I'd say this book focuses on preparing the skin, applying foundations, and transforming eyes (including brows). There is lots of useful, detailed information on applying makeup for your face shape, and eye shape.  I only gave this book 4 stars (but would have given it more like 4.5 stars if I could) because I was disappointed that it did not go into more detail about the lip colors used on the ladies.  Overall I am very pleased.  I find this book to be very helpful guide for personal use.

Mr K is positively bubbling with enthusiasim.  Had it not been taken by Joe Namath a suitable title might have been \\"The Future's So Bright I Just Gotta Wear Shades\\".  But therein lies the problem.  Mr K comes across more like a passionate evangelical than a reasoned scientist.  Whenever someone is absolutley convinced about the rightness of his assumptions I become skeptical. <br /> <br />     If you're reading this you know the premise of the book.  Mr. K maintains that the pace of technological change (and by technology he means the really cool technologies, like infotech, biotech, and nanotech) is not simply increasing, but increasing exponentially, so fast that we will soon reach a point where man and machine have become one, and are brains are a million (or maybe a billion) times more powerful.  When this happens everything we know will have changed forever. <br /> <br />     Moreover, this is not someting that will happen at some vague time in the far future.  It's just around the corner.  Mr. K even gives us a date: 2045. <br /> <br />     While reading the book I kept thinking, What if Mr. K had written this in the mid 1950's?  Certainly he'd have backup for his basic premise--the changes that occured in the first half of the 20th century were indeed tremendous.  Take aviation, a hot technology in those days.  Mr. K would no doubt have observed that we went from Kitty Hawk to the Boeing 707 in just 50 years.  Projecting ahead, Mr. K would have concluded that the second half of the century would see an even [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker rate of advancement, so that by now we'd all have our own personal flying devices, zipping off to Europe in just minutes. <br /> <br />    But that hasn't happened.  Certainly there has been signigicant progress in aviation in the last 50 years, but not like the 50 years before that.  In some says it's worse.  I suspect that since 9/11 the time it takes to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco (from the time you get to one airport to the time you leave the other) may be longer now than it was in the 1950's. <br /> <br />    Why has this happened?  A lot of this has to do with social conditions, not technological ones.  Supersonic trasport never got off the ground (so to speak) in part because people didn't want the sonic booms near populated areas.  These same social factors may well put the brakes on a lot of what Mr. K predicts. <br /> <br />     It's not that Mr. K's book isn't based on hard science.  It's positively larded with science, so much so that my eyes tended to glaze over many times.  It's just that he doesn't seem very critical.  While he does acknowledge the existence of contrary opinion, he quickly (albeit politely) dismisses any cautionary thoughts.  Those who disagree with his beliefs are clearly stuck-in-the-mud, nay-saying Luddites. <br /> <br />    Mr K is obviously a brilliant, well-informed scientist.  I don't have enough knowledge to judge the accuracy of his facts, except in a few situations.  When that does occur, though, I become unimpressed.  For example, he spends a few pages talking about the increases that have occured in life expectancy, and uses this to project further increases to 150 years and then to 500 years.  But he fails to distinguish between life exoectancy and life span.  The former has indeed increased, but the latter has not.  I am certain Mr. K knows the difference.  His failure to make the distinction is misleading and disingenuous.  It makes me wonder about the veracity of the rest of the book. <br /> <br />     As to the book itself, it's far too long.  He repeats his points so much it seems as though he thinks that by mere repetition the reader will become more convinced that he's right.  And some parts of the book are simply annoying, like the smug pseudo-conversations among past, present, and future personages that appear throughout the work. <br /> <br />To his credit, though, his optimisim about the future is refreshing, and certainly an antidote to the dystopian views typical in literature and Hollywood (Brave New World, 1984, Blade Runner, Mad Max, The Terminator, Waterworld, etc.). <br /> <br />     The bottom line here is that Mr. K. doesn't seem to remember that virtually all predictions about the future are wrong, since the predictions are simply extrapolations of current trends.  The future is never what we think it will be, and Mr. K is no exception. <br /> <br />     Then again, he could be right.  If so, I just hope I can live long enough to enjoy the sigularity, so I can have my body filled with nanobots and my brain uploaded to (as he would say) a suitable substrate.  Maybe being a cyborg won't be so bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     <br />	2005-10-13

Books	5	6	7	N	N	For anyone who has even dreamed of setting up their own business	This is a terrific book for anyone who has ever considered or dreamed of going into business for himself (or herself).  Frankly, that is about everyone.  I suspect that you have thought about getting out of the 9-5 rat race or getting out of the cubicle farm, but have probably not made the leap into the unknown because too much is unknown and we have responsibilities that limit the risks we can afford to take.  This book is much like sitting around with an experienced and friendly uncle who takes you step by step through the things you absolutely must think through before you can seriously consider walking into the jungle of business with the hope of walking out rich.<br /><br />Steve Gottry bases this book on his own entrepreneurial efforts; some successful, others ended in bitter failure.  He not only shares the lessons he learned, but extends them into more general lessons about the broad considerations anyone in business must wrestle with.  He groups the twenty-three chapters in three broad parts.<br /><br />Part One is in two parts: The Small Business Life Cycle, and The Alternate Route.  The first part is for the person who has any kind of desire to be in business, but doesn't know what he would face.  It starts with the dreaming stage and helps you get to something more solid.  Of course, most of the dreams we have would make lousy businesses, but if you pan enough in the stream of ideas you might find a nugget of real gold.  Such is one path to business.  He then takes you through the planning and implementation stages.  Once you are in business you hope you will have to deal with growth.  You will also likely have to adapt and evolve your business, and at some point you will sell it, close it, or pass it on to heirs.<br /><br />The Alternate Route takes you through what you must consider if things go badly and you have to deal with creditors and possibly bankruptcy.  He also guides you through your second start-up.  Realistically, if you have what it takes to be on your own, you will never be happy working for someone else for the long term.  You might have to get a paycheck to get back on your feet, but you will eventually head out on your own once again.<br /><br />Part Two takes you through the process of building on your assets.  This is not as obvious as it might seem because it really is more than just your genius product or service.  In order to build a loyal customer base, to fight off competitors, to have a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K employee team, and to be happy with your life, you really do need to think through these issues.<br /><br />Part Three takes you through those negatives in yourself and your company that can drag you down.  They include being distracted by being busy with non-core activities, a poisonous employee or culture, being sloppy, too much debt, getting on the wrong side of Uncle Sam, and letting your fears keep you from doing what must be done.  It is a painful look in the mirror, but to be successful look you must!<br /><br />One feature of this book I particularly like is the \\"Thinking It Through\\" section at the end of each chapter.  He lists the core questions the chapter raised and leaves spaces for you to write out your answers.  Actually, the answers will be too detailed to fit in the few lines he leaves you, but they are there to suggest - demand - that you take the time to not move forward until you have written out the answers to these questions.  Not that you will get them set down once and for all, but that you start the process of thinking in a serious way.  Writing it down forces you to organize your thoughts and helps you judge them critically.  So write.<br /><br />This is not a textbook and many of the issues he raises here will start you on your process.  You will need to study some of them more deeply or get professional guidance to supplement your own skills.

Muzj, a literate scholar who can communicate with the non-specialist, picks several of the most classic icon images and explicates them in short essays that are nevertheless dense with observation, learning, and insight.<br /><br />The entire book is on acid-free paper and the reproductions are carefully picked from the best examples of each iconic image known.  The major Russian schools are represented in more than one image to aid the learner in becoming familiar with them.  Muzj also provides diagrams of the way the space is utilized in each image to unfailingly lead the eye to the central mystery of faith being revealed behind each icon.<br /><br />In short, there is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal of learning packed here into a relatively small volume for a quite reasonable price.  Especially for Western tradition Christians who have only appreciated icons from a distance, this remarkable book is a door to a whole new world.	2005-10-13

No book has ever made me laugh and smile the way this did. Faced with many difficult situations in her young life, the straight shooting Daisy Fay possesses an inner strength that enables her to come out a winner. How could one not love such an innocent yet an insightful young woman? Kudos to Ms. Flagg for not giving us another typical victim of circumstance that cannot figure out how to pull herself up by her bootstraps! <br /> <br />After reading Flagg's Whistlestop novel, I was skeptical that this one could actually be AS good. But guess what? It was! After a couple chapters, or journal entries, I should say, I was hooked. \\"Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man\\" (earlier edition entitled \\"Coming Attractions\\") really made me grin with a tearful grin. So much (about 1/2) of the book is told from the perspective of an 11-year-old in a pretty messed-up family situation. Of course she doesn't realize this, and thus the writer escapes the trite trap. Her insights and honesty on the page really touched me. It was as refreshing as deep breath after a long walk--hits your lungs, exhilarating your whole heart....and again, the main character (can you guess her name?) was chock-full of hilarity; a real original! If you like good reading, you'll love Daisy Fay and her various scrapes and adventures, with \\"the Miracle Man\\", and Flagg's other kooky characters! (P.S.

The solution to the mystery plot, which centers around Spenser's client's involvement or non-involvement in the shooting, has another \\"ripped from the headlines\\" true-life inspiration, though I won't say which one because I don't want to give away the eventual plot and character revelations.<br /><br />I'll just report, then, that this was a better-than-average installment among recent Spenser novels and it was refreshing that it was JUST a Spenser novel:  It wasn't about Hawk or Susan or Vinnie or anybody else.  Don't get me wrong, the supporting cast in this series is [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K.

US	36642996	R2XV4UFS5M9AI5	1400098424	656948149	13 Steps Down	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A riveting and compelling psychological thriller with a complex plot and believable characters	Ruth Rendell is one of those writers who always gets it right. Her new novel titled 13 STEPS DOWN is a chilling story of obsession, superstition, hatred, guilt, fantasy lives and murder. Mix Cellini is a disenfranchised young man who makes his living repairing and maintaining exercise equipment. He is superstitious and shudders when he is forced to confront the number 13, which happens to be the number of steps that lead to his flat in a neglected and crumbling old Victorian house. His fears and his belief in ghosts and the occult haunt him. He is single and rents the attic space from Gwendolen Chawcer, an elderly spinster who has lived alone for many years amid the dust, dirt, mess, her cat Otto, and the fabulous collections of books that sustain her life. Mix hates her. And the feeling is mutual. <br /> <br />As the story unfolds we learn that Gwendolen was one of those females whose life was determined and controlled by her overbearing father. After her mother died, she was expected to take care of Mr. Chawcer and never to strike out on her own. Unfortunately, he lived to the ripe-old age of 94, thus never giving his daughter a chance to meet people, especially men. He had made up his mind that she was not \\"marriage material\\" and would be better off reading and learning how to take care of him. Despite her isolation and naivet she fell in love with the young doctor who cared for her father. But once the old man died, she never heard from him again. Nevertheless, she carried a torch for him for 50 years and over time it became a heavy burden for her. <br /> <br />And since her father died, she has lived alone in a few of the many rooms in the house she had grown up in. For her, the structure is familiar and she really doesn't see the crumbling wallpaper, peeling paint, or very out-of-date appliances (which she never uses anyway), nor does she feel the cold. Mix is her first border and he is not happy with his situation. He thinks he can hear \\"drippings and droppings, moths chewing, flakes falling, splinters, rust mildew turning to dust.\\" He bemoans his fate at ever having stepped over the threshold of this place. But once he allows his fantasies to purge any hold on reality he ever had, he has only one purpose and that becomes his whole focus. <br />   <br />Mix, who takes his women where and when he can get them, meets a gorgeous model, Nerissa Nash. As soon as he sets eyes on her, he knows that she must be his and he begins to stalk her. Nerissa is clueless for a good portion of the story, though readers can guess what is going to happen and it is not good. Mix is also obsessed with a notorious doctor who not only performed abortions 50 years ago, but also killed the women he butchered and indulged in the act of necrophilia before he buried them. He is Mix's idol, and Mix takes strength and inspiration from the collection of books he owns that are all about the infamous doctor. <br /> <br />Readers get to meet a number of supporting players, including Madame Shoshanna, the phony and sadistic \\"psychic\\" who meddles with an eye toward trouble; Danila, the young woman Mix meets at a spa and begins to date; and the customers Mix calls on to fix their exercise equipment --- mostly women --- and with whom he indulges in a little extracurricular recreation. But none of this is really important to him. He is fixated on Nerissa to the point where his obsession pushes him over the line from a very neurotic young man to a dangerous psychopath. <br /> <br />Ruth Rendell is a master craftsperson at creating the creepy atmosphere required to write a riveting and compelling psychological thriller. She doesn't need to use an extra word or gesture, or any gratuitous baggage, to draw her readers in and keep them turning pages and biting their nails. Her plots are complex and have enough gravitas to keep the most ardent reader entertained. Because her characters are fully fleshed out and believable, they are also recognizable as people, andthat can be very scary. <br /> <br />In an essay for Kings and Queens of Crime, Val McDermid highlights Rendell's art: \\"Perhaps one of the key reasons for the sustained quality of [her] novels is Ruth Rendell's habit of variety. From the very beginning of her career, she made it plain that she would not be pigeonholed into writing one kind of novel only ... Patricia Highsmith is often cited as the mother of the psychological suspense novel. But for my money, Rendell's influence has been far [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker. Highsmith's novels are quintessentially European, whereas Ruth Rendell has created a sub-genre that speaks more resonantly to Brits and Americans.\\" <br /> <br />The tone of Rendell's books is always highly suspenseful and tightly constructed. Her [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest talent is her ability to create characters and plots that are multilayered, interesting and a challenge to readers. She is one of the small coterie of novelists who can manage to produce work that is always new and no two books are the same Her body of work is legion and readers can always count on getting a fresh, well-crafted book. In an interview for Financial Literary Newsletter she says, \\"There's a lot of satisfaction also, in knowing that people feel that once they've got hold of a book of yours, they can't put it down. It distracts them from everything else, it takes them from all their duties, and they just have to finish the book. And that's a very satisfying thing.\\" <br /> <br />13 STEPS DOWN is more confirmation of how much Rendell deserves the fine reputation she has earned among readers and other writers. Those new to Rendell's more than 70 books will find her latest novel unique, meeting the high standards that Rendell has always imposed upon herself and that has become expected from her by an adoring public. This book is a keeper, definitely to be read more than once. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum	2005-10-13

Faith McNulty and Steven Kellogg have done a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K job of showing and telling children what a trip to the moon would really be like. <br /> <br />One thing that is [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K about this book is the way experiences and things that are familiar to children are used to describe extraordinarily UN-familiar experiences and ideas. The book is written in the second person point of view -- directly addressing the reader. I thought it was brilliant the way McNulty captures what a child's (or anyone's) feelings might be as they hurtle through the dark expanse of space, far away from the comfort of Earth and home. (\\"Up here in space you may feel very alone. Don't look back at the Earth. It would make you even lonelier.\\")  <br /> <br />Kellogg illustrates a variety of moods, experiences and concepts from eye-catching perspectives. There is whimsy: an astronaut floats weightlessly around inside the capsule amidst a swarm of playing cards, and, later in the book an unexpected herd of hypothetical moon cows makes an appearance! There is quite a lot of loneliness in Kellogg's space: A lone astronaut hops around and explores the strange, barren, black and grey moonscape for several pages. In a compelling two-page spread, Kellogg depicts a lone astronaut, standing on the Moon under a lonely black sky -- the scene is printed with the darkest jet black ink I have EVER seen printed in any picture book. At the end of the journey, the astronaut returns to an exuberant fold out frieze of Earth's magnificently varied biodiversity, under a shining sun and clear sky with children swimming in fresh, clear water -- the essential element that makes our planet habitable. I was especially pleased to see this book, since another excellent children's book about the Moon, E.C. and Robin Krupp's book, The Moon and You, is not readily available anymore. I highly recommend this book for any elementary school library, or for the book collections of Kindergarteners to second graders. I also would not be surprised if it wins some children's book awards in the months to come.	2005-10-13

Isabel Hull exposes the flaw of this approach in her book. Accroding to Hull, German soldiers committed numoerous atrocities from the Herro uprising to the First World War due to belief in absolute victory and the absence of civilian supervision. This was seen in the destruction of the Herro tribe in which the Germans delibrately starved the tribe to death, and the complaints by the civilian governors were ignored by the German government. The German government imposed no controls on the military because the conservative political parties supported the army and the SPD did not want to appear as though they were not supporting the troops. The German army continued these same practices during the First World War through the massacre of Belgian civilians, and the expulsion of French civilians. Also the German army encouraged the Turks in their genocide against the Armenians. These measures only tarnished Germany's reputation and were militarily counterproductive. I would strongly reccomend this book to people like Robert Kaplan, who wants the military to run wild in foreign adventures.	2005-10-13

Even that redoutable master of brilliant and modern-reading prose, Wilkie Collins, cannot keep up with Verne at his best. How so much seemingly tedious description is lifted to this level of fluidity - flat out amazing.<br />Verne's genius for what we today call Science Fiction sometimes obscures his even [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker gift, for pure narrative. And with the  Mysterious Island in this new translation his talent is on full display. Verne creates with this island an entire new world, a sort of Eden, and within this landscape plays out an entirely breathtaking story. Lingering in the backdrop, Verne's embittered alter ego Nemo balances the one-sided idealism of the castaways.  On a scale with the Count of Monte Cristo, and the literary culmination of the enlightenment/scientific shipwrecked theme,(versus the 'humans are animals Lord of the Flies alternative), the Mysterious Island builds steadily to a tremendous finish.<br />  When we read 19th century fiction much of the time phrases and scenes are flat, stale; even the best writers, Dickens, or Trollope, Balzac or Hawthorne, have streches of writing that just doesn't read as anything but dated. But Verne's best books, and this certainly is one of them, are as remarkable for their uncluttered fine prose writing as they are for their famous plots and explorations.<br />If Verne was no [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K creator of character, he makes up for it by some of the most eminently readable works ever penned.<br />A wonderful book for reading during a cold long winter weekend.	2005-10-13

Why do I then only give it three stars? The author explains everything very well. HOWEVER, for someone that's never used the router before, words often leave you fumbling. A picture is worth 1000 words and it couldn't be more true in this case. There are pictures. Just no enough of them and they're in a weird black and white and funny kind of red deal. Not very clear at all. So you often have two pages of words where one clear picture would have replaced all of it and done a better job. <br /> <br />The second problem I had was the fact that this book essentially ignores the plunge router. This is fine. He pretty much shows how you can do everything with the vertical and horizontal router table and the many, many jigs, fences and accessories. However, I bought a mid power (2 1/4 HP) porter cable plunge router and almost feel that I should return it for the 3 HP one which would have cost me the same amount of money because his bias seems to indicate the plunge router is not necessary. <br /> <br />Finally, the part where he mentions how to add a switch to your router table is confusing. Thank goodness I know how electrical work, so I could figure things out. However, SJT appliance cable is not something you can pick up at your local home depot. A source list on this would have been extremely helpful. <br /> <br />All in all, however, it is still a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book.	2005-10-13

The tab's a little off from video recordings of Django playing these same tunes, but the notes are right.<br /><br />That's about where it ends, though. The recording, while technically a decent recording, offers no insight to Django's phrasing or timing of the notes. There are entire passages where it felt like Rod was just playing the notes and nothing more. Other times, notes were missed, played sloppily or not picked up by the mic, leading to a sloppy, unrehearsed sound. There's an entire passage in the Minor Swing recording where Rod plays the most boring note-for-note reiteration of his transcription despite Django's clear swing rhythm and sliding techniques on the same passage in the recording it was transcribed from.<br /><br />Overall, this is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book to get as a bio, and a pretty good one for the transcriptions. However, don't try to learn from the CD, because Django would probably be rolling over in his grave.

Let me just say it straight:  The Yankees is a cult for social club zombies.  There is no such thing as the Yankees.  There is only such thing as other teams' MVPs.  (Kinda like that song OPP.)    Living in NY and hearing people idolize the Yankees really grosses you out if you are on the outside looking in.  Watch the YES network and watch Yankees highlights from 300 years ago, reminding you of the history of your cult.  I'm glad the Yankees do horribly.  Yes.  Glad.  And you know why.  Writing about is is redudant, for now I will only poke fun at the modern Yankees.    I was raised in Houston, so painfully I was an Astros fan for a couple decades now.  I laughed hysterically when the Stros NO-HIT the Yankees with like 6 pitchers I believe.  I even kept the Newsday paper it was printed on the back cover of.  Priceless.

I don't care if humanity gets wiped out by aliens or nukes or whatever - we MUST preserve what happened in 2004 between the Yankees/Red Sox.  Hey, why don't we start by replaying it over the YES airwaves for the next 60 decades.    There is this guy that I lived with who was a hysterical Yankees cult zombie.  He claimed that \\"nobody can beat the Yankees, the Yankees beat the Yankees, they beat themselves only.\\"  Now it is true that the Yankees beat themsleves (if by \\"Yankees\\" you mean Steinbrenner) but oh my do other teams whoop them silly.  The Angels, Fish, Red Sox... Devil Rays.  Do I care that other teams own the Yankees?  Nope.  I care that people are so brainwashed by Yankee propaganda that they actually do, and not only do, but can't accept reality about such things.  If you are a Yankees fan: Sit down. Take a deep breath.  Now let it out.  Relax.  The Yankees are a bad team and they are owned.  There.  That wasn't so hard now was it?    Here is why people hate the Yankees.  If you have a team with a low or medium pay roll, and you have a player who is special and pretty much carried your team for a season, kiss him goodbye, he's a Yankee next season.  How fun is it to have that on your conscience every time somebody is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K player?  I'll tell ya this, and I'm sure you will agree - it ruins the sport.  I am not a football fan, but I do love the playoffs in football.  Why?  Because of the variety of the champs.  They win with what they have.  Sure they trade, but they don't buy everyone's MVPs the next season.  They have their team captains that sail the ship and a solid coach.  Every sport is going to have its Clippers, Browns, and Devil Rays.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that if the Rays had a shining star, there is only a dust cloud where his body once played the season before.  Other sports will surround their special talents with other players who share the same determination to win.  The salaray cap helps this happen.      Here, let me break it down for you yet again.  After the Yankees \\"beat themselves\\" to the Angels (for the second time within 5 years), there was an article in the newspaper with a \\"sports writer\\" discussing his \\"plan\\" for 2006.  It involved attaining Torii Hunter, Barry Zito, Rafael Furcal, Manny Ramirez, and John Olerud.  He even talked about getting Johnny Damon and some other guys.  Case in point?  Another Frankenstein team featuring stars from other teams as the solution to the problem.  Yes, bring in more people who don't know each other to magically fix the problem that has started before they came into the picture.  No. This is not a sound solution to anything.  How does this happen?  No salary cap, greedy players, and a sport with no soul.  May I suggest, mr. sports writer that you make better with what you HAVE and building a team rather than next year's side show you only love to hate?    Consider the fact that they get bought from other teams as heros and leave as zeros.  Why do they go from moutains on other teams to valleys in pinstripes?  Because the Yankees headquarters looks desperate and pathetic begging for others to come in and save them.  I mean it really is sad.  But if you can't try to learn from your mistakes and keep repeating them, you don't get my sympathy.  Only a couple laughs.    It isn't homeruns the Yankees need, its a personality, a heart, a team.  They don't need guys who think homeruns and strikeouts are owed to them, but guys who will break and bleed for them.  Its not even HOW you spend the money but WHY.  If you're spending alot on a big name just to fill seats, you have received your reward.  If you spend big just because you don't want your rivals to have a player, you roll the dice on the field and in the clubhouse.  You see the Yankees is a Rubick's cube of a team.  A Frankenstein.  An arm from Seattle, a leg from Pittsburgh, a toe from St. Louis, an ear from San Diego, and half a cheek from Cleveland.  They went looking for pieces but have no heart.   Aside from Tino and Jeter, there is no such thing as a Yankee anymore.    The only time I cared about the Yankees was when they had O'Neil, Brosius (sp), Sojo and all those guys.  They were fun to watch because they weren't all superstars, and you wanted to see the skills of guys who wanted to fight for their championship.  (Even though I still rooted against them back then, I never hated them.  I'm a NL fan, what do you want from me?)    Yankees Cult Graveyard - R.I.P.

I never quite believed Lord Scarecrow and Jack could be real (whereas I'm still convinced Lyra and her Daemon are out there somewhere from \\"His Dark Materials\\").  It's always a bit of a disappointment to not become so engrossed in a book, the characters become real.  However, that's about the only disappointment.<br /><br />Lord Scarecrow and his turnip head (though I kept picturing him as the scarecrow from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\") is anxious to seek his fortune and rescue his birthplace from being polluted.  On their tail is a lawyer working for the Buffalonis, the polluting family, who reminds me of Count Olaf.  Poor Jack just wants to stay alive and not be hungry.  In between are many adventures including a desert island, joining the military, which all leads to a climactic courtroom scene.<br /><br />A [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K fairy tale for the preteen set (and us older preteens as well).	2005-10-13

US	21924524	R3TYCFHJI5SYW6	0879308656	658294281	All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music (All Music Guides)	Books	4	80	81	N	Y	A unique new guide ... but oh-so tiny print	This giant, 5 lb, small-print guide is not exactly a book you nestle down with in your reading chair.  Let the buyer beware: if you are a person who cannot or does not like to read really, really FINE PRINT, then this guide is probably not for you.  It has by far the tiniest print I have seen in a book - even smaller than the \\"Third Ear Guide to Classical Music\\" if you are familiar with that one.<br /><br />In my first look at this monster-of-a-guide, I could not get beyond this tiny print and the overly-plain visual layout.  But, with another long look, the value of this unique guide started to stand out clearly. There is a reason for such tiny print - to cram in an unbelievably vast amount of information in one volume.  The All Music Guide is enormously ambitious in what is contains:<br />o  BIOGRAPHIES of over 500 composers AND 800 performers (unprecidented in one volume)<br />o  Fairly detailed PROGRAM NOTES for an impressively large number of works (not just the major ones)<br />o  Listings of 2-6 RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS for each work (but no comparison or explanations of the choices like Penguin)<br />o  ESSAYS on the major musical periods and forms (difficult to read these longer sections with the tiny font size!)<br /><br />The amount and level of detail of the program notes is impressive - giving musical history, perspective and minor analysis for not only a given category of work (say, Mozart's 27 piano concertos) but also most or all of the individual works!  These essays are not unlike those found in a CD liner notes.  So, with this guide, you can look up the background and musical insights of Mozart's concerto #20 as well as see what recordings/astists are recommended for that one concerto. The only other guide that does this is Penguin Guide.  So, now can you appreciate why this book has such tiny print and weighs a ton?  But, as enormous as this guide is, don't expect EVERY composition to be listed.  For instance, under \\"Beethoven\\" there is ample discussion about the string quartets, there is little text or recordings for the ten violin sonatas and early string trios.<br /><br />Another valuable aspect for many will be the biographies of the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K past and present PERFORMERS.  This volume contains fairly detailed highlights of each artist career (2-4 paragraphs) AND a listing of their finest recordings for performers like Argerich, Grumiaux, Perlman, Perahia, Rubinstein, Horowitz, Galloway, Holzinger, Bain and so on.  (But some of your personal favorites may not be there - like Rachel Podger and Pamela Frank for me).  However, I found the performer biographies a bit dry with not enough juicy details about their lives, styles and sometimes quirky sides to make it really compelling and interesting.  (tip: one of the best books for fascinating personal stories on the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K pianists is David Dubal's book, \\"The Art of the Piano\\").<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that the AMG is NOT a CD/DVD guide as it only LISTS a few recommended recordings and does not compare/contrast/explain them (like Penguin, Third Ear, or Gramophone Guides).  But, then again the title says \\"Guide to Classical Music\\" and not \\"Guide to CD's DVD's\\" like the others.  So, its a different animal.  But, I thought the AMG's focused recommendations were up-to-date and reliable overall, giving a good range of historic, modern, and budget choices.  All-in-all, a valuable addition if you already have Penguin, Gramophone and Third Ear Guides to Classical Music.	2005-10-13

My family just came back from the Smokies a month ago and I happened to bring back this little book. One thing you should know about me is that I try to buy a couple of books on the region of the country that we are visiting. This was one of them. I am intrigued by the history of the places I visit. The Smokies is definitely one place that we are going back to.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating look at life in the mountains. It is not your stereotypical book either ~~ these women are magnificent women and the author brings their stories to life just by describing their daily routines, their beliefs and how life in the mountains were lived. Their lives were not easy ~~ and nor were they idle. But they were not complainers ~~ and obviously it worked for them as they stayed in the mountains fourteen years or so after the Smokies became a national park.  <br /> <br />This book is packed with tidbits of history and some of their superstitions. It is full of information on how they survived off the land ~~ just like the Indians, they made use of just about everything they either grow or made. The author told of how they courted among themselves, how they entertained one another (with stories by the fireplace, dances and music and church-goings ~~ even chores were oftentimes excuses to get together and visit), and how they survived in the wilderness without doctors or hospitals nearby. <br /> <br />If you are looking for something that reminds you of your ancestors' lives, this is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book to pick up! It is a slim volume but it is packed full of interesting tidbits. It gives you an idea of just how hard life can be in those days and sometimes, how much more richer it really was.  <br /> <br />10-12-05	2005-10-13

Pi's creativity and strong will keeps the reader entranced and often surprised.  Even in Part I, when the novel seems to be random tidbits about Pi's life, the little descriptions and short stories are creative and often humorous.  However, I had thought that this book would, as it said, make me \\"believe in God.\\"  Because I thought I was going to discover insight on God, I was disappointed.  The majority of the book does not focus on religion or God at all.  Even though Pi lives and that probably required God's help, a story like that should not be called one that makes you \\"believe in God.\\"  If you do not expect to gain truths about God and wish to fall into a captivating story of a young boys fantastic survival, Li of Pi can fulfill, but it can not fulfill its promise of making \\"you believe in God.\\"  I rated it a four because of this disappointment in its lack of fulfillment in its promise and for a lack of definite conclusion.  I did find the twist at the end with the other version of Pi's story to be fascinating.  I had accepted pretty much everything he had told us up until that point, and I thought it was [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K that Pi could have been making up/ imagining the animals and other things.  To me that seems to be a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K coping mechanism for young Pi that helped him deal with the problems he faced.  I do however wish that the author would not have left the book hanging with the reader wondering whether or not Pi's story with the animals was the one that really happened or the one with the humans.  If the animal version was true, this would not necessarily make me \\"believe in God;\\" it would make me believe in the power of imagination.	2005-10-13

Empiricism is seen in distinction from Rationalism, in that it doubts the viability of universal principles (rational or otherwise), and uses sense data as the basis of all knowledge - experience is the source of knowledge. Hume was a skeptic as well as empiricist, and had radical (for the time) atheist ideas that often got in the way of his professional advancement, but given his reliance on experience (and the kinds of experiences he had), his problem with much that was considered conventional was understandable.<br /><br />Hume's major work, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', was not well received intially - according to Hume, 'it fell dead-born from the press'. Hume reworked the first part of this work in a more popular way for this text, which has become a standard, and perhaps the best introduction to Empiricism.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the idea of empiricism is that experience teaches, and rules and understanding are derived from this. However, for Hume this wasn't sufficient. Just because billiard balls when striking always behave in a certain manner, or just because the sun always rose in the morning, there was no direct causal connection that could be automatically affirmed - we assume a necessary connection, but how can this be proved?<br /><br />Hume's ideas impact not only metaphysics, but also epistemology and psychology. Hume develops empiricism to a point that empiricism is practically unsupportable (and it is in this regard that Kant sees this text as a very important piece, and works toward his synthesis of Empiricism and Rationalism). For Hume, empirical thought requires skepticism, but leaves it unresolved as far as what one then needs to accept with regard to reason and understanding. According to scholar Eric Steinberg, 'A view that pervades nearly all of Hume's philosophical writings is that both ancient and modern philosophers have been guilty of optimistic and exaggerated claims for the power of human reason.'<br /><br />Some have seen Hume as presenting a fundamental mistrust of daily belief while recognising that we cannot escape from some sort of framework; others have seen Hume as working toward a more naturalist paradigm of human understanding. In fact, Hume is open to a number of different interpretations, and these different interpretations have been taken up by subsequent philosphers to develop areas of synthetic philosophical ideas, as well as further developments more directly out of Empiricism (such as Phenomenology).<br /><br />The text of Hume is in fact a rather short book, a mere 100 pages or so in many editions (it is about 120 in this edition). As a primer for understanding Hume, the British Empiricists (who include Hobbes, Locke, and Berkeley), as well as the major philosphical concerns of the eighteenth century, this is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K text with which to start.<br /><br />Editor Tom. L. Beauchamp has provided an extensive section of annotations (over half as long as the Hume's text itself), as well as generous section on variations and emendations.

It started perfectly, and kept getting better and better until I thought I was going to jump out of my skin if I read another word. I was wrong about that. My skin is still intact, but not by much. <br /> <br />FEVER is written by Sean Rowe, who has quite a background. He's been hit by a train and lived to tell about it; he's won awards for journalistic achievement; and, most pertinent for our purposes here today, he includes working as a copy reader for Adam & Eve --- a mail order company dealing in, uh, adult recreational products --- on his job resume. Although his debut novel doesn't have any photos or drawings going for it, Rowe nonetheless demonstrates that he is a craftsman of the highest order. <br /> <br />The story begins with what is probably the most ingenious frameups I've encountered in quite a while. It is Matt \\"Loose Cannon\\" Shannon who is on the receiving end of it; what hurts is that his stepbrother, Jack Fontana, sets up the whole thing. Fontana is freshly out of prison on an early release and has the ultimate rip-off planned --- the theft of a fortune in drug money that is secretly being transported in a cruise ship named the Norwegian Empress. <br /> <br />The problem --- one of many in this thrill-a-page novel --- is that Shannon, a retired FBI agent, is the security chief for the world's largest cruise line, whose holdings include the Empress. The frame ensures Cannon's reluctant cooperation. Fontana recruits a mixed bag of talent to pull off the heist, some of whom are tied to Shannon's past in ways he is totally unaware. The operation fluctuates wildly between success and failure from moment to moment, with Shannon having to wing it more often than not simply to stay alive and free at any given time. <br /> <br />And stealing the money is only half the battle. Shannon and Fontana first have to retrieve it and then hang on to it, all the while avoiding the law and lawless. Rowe isnothing less than marvelous here. Just when you think things aren't going to get any worse, they do. And when you think they can't possibly get better, they...well, you'll have to read the book to find out. <br /> <br />FEVER just might be one of the best thriller reads of the year, a year that has been full of [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K ones already.

Having read all 6 books in the series I can say that J.K. Rowling is nowhere near the quality writer that J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis were. Second, I would never recommend these books to young readers because of the violence that gets increasingly worse in each succeeding book.  The books  characters, i.e. witches, wizzards, etc. use \\"good\\" magic and \\"bad\\" magic. There is no such thing as \\"good\\" magic. These books stir up an unhealthy interest in the occult and the blackness that accompanies it. Harry Potter and his friends also take [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K delight in the misfortunes of others and many times contrive to cause these misfortunes to occur to those they dislike.

US	43586748	R2CIPUQBC22U7T	0060823844	915422162	Anansi Boys	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Excellent Story, Excellent Performance.	I've got something of a love/hate relationship with audiobooks.  I love to be read to, and I love filling up the time on a long commute with a story.  I hate abridgements, I hate readers who ham things up, and I hate productions that feel the need to underscore the mood with music cues (taking attention away from the story).  A [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K performance can make a poor story interesting, and make a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K story shine. <br /> <br />In every respect that I can think of, Lenny Henry's reading of Neil Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys\\" is the standard which every audiobook should reach for. <br /> <br />THE STORY <br />is excellent.  Neil has given us something of a comedy of manners, a family story that is very much a comedy in the P.G. Woodehouse mode (except with supernatural beings, their progency, those who love them, and their blogging roommates). Its one of those tight stories that take the time to show you what's going on and still astonishes.  I'm not going to take up too much more time gushing on this front.  Let's end this section with the fact that I had more fun reading this book than anything else I've read in a couple of years. <br /> <br />THE PERFORMANCE <br />is what I really wanted to mention.  Lenny Henry SHINES!  His pace is easy and not too rushed.  His accents (Carribean, American, English; and regional/cultural subsets of each) are good without being camp.  And most importantly, he offers a dozen or so exact, distinctive, age appropriate and recognizable voices for each character. <br /> <br />I cannot stress that last one enough.  One must sympathize with the difficult task of one voice coming up with all these voices.  Some audiobooks solve the problems by having more than one reader or just having the reader read in their own voice and use cues in the text (\\"...said Virginia hotly\\") to fill in the blanks. Other books too are first person narratives that lend themselves better to audiobooks. <br /> <br />Far too often, though, an actor will exaggerate something tocreate a distinctive voice for a character (ESPECIALLY a male reader reading a woman's part).  It is painful to hear someone adding an inappropriate speech impedement or something like a southern drawl just so that the listener can tell characters apart.   <br /> <br />Lenny avoids all of these pitfalls without the need of crutches.  In a third-person situation telling a sprawling (if short) tale in three different countries, his performance is masterful.  10 hours never flew by so fast. <br /> <br />I'm now going to purchase other audiobooks he's read just so I can hear him!	2005-10-13

Very few. So when I saw the Times review a while back, along with a recommendation from my closest friend, I had a mixture of trepidation and curiosity.  The one exception to this \\"run screaming in the other direction\\" reaction has been this highly imaginative and riveting work by Jackson McCrae.  It's hard to go into things here as far as plot, characters, tie-ins, etc. as so many others have done that and you can see for yourself that many people love this work.   <br /> <br />One of the themes of this book is that of redemption through forgiveness. But the path is not easy and McCrae does make us work through the process, just as he had to.  Short story chapters of his life alternate with present day New York job stress and remembrances.  These two \\"styles\\" and chapter-types play off one another until they build to an incredibly emotional and devestating climax.  When you do get to the climax of the novel, be prepared. You will need to stop, put the book down, and pick your jaw up off the floor.  I guarantee you that you've never read anything as shocking as this one chapter. Someone once said that there is nothing new under the sun. I've alway believed that---until I read this book.  The horrific incident that fuels the writer's quest to find out what happened to him as a child is so totally devestating that you'll be in shock for weeks.  Graphic? Oh, yes. Not for the squeamish either.  But it works perfectly and after that, all the stories that came before it make perfect sense.  It's as if this novel is one big puzzle and McCrae is putting it together for you, one piece at a time.  When he does finally give you the last piece, you fall back, amazed that you didn't see it coming.    <br /> <br />Built from the ground up, this literary masterpiece is far beyond anything out on the book market today.  If you read the many reviews you'll seethat there are references upon references to Capote.  While this is indeed correct, it's only a \\"jumping off\\" point and not meant to be an exact replica of that author's style or thought process.  It's as if the writer \\"in the book\\" is enamored with Mr. C and can't help himself. But this is really only a small portion of this [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K and well-built novel. Forget all this---the metaphors, the layers, the tie-ins to Keller, Capote, and any and every other literary tricks the author is capable of----and his technique is admirable, even genius.  But this is, above all, a story from the heart.  It's about people connecting.  It's about finding out who you are.  It's about life's experiences, good and bad.  It's about the horrible things people do to each other.  And it's about the goodness in people.  This novel is life itself.   <br /> <br />It's been said that everyone has a story to tell.  Trust me-no one has one quite like this.  There's something about the settings, the timing, the brave human acts of kindness, that could not be replicated anywhere, anytime, at any other place in the world.  McCrae has taken the very center of the Civil Rights movement and used it as a character itself.  Couple this with the heroics of the African-American housekeeper and you've got a formula for success.  Which is exactly what this book is----success. For those who get what the author is trying to do, please pass this along to a friend.  This book is based on a true story, and only a small portion of names and places have been changed. That the author was able to bare his soul and laugh at certain incidents only reinforces the idea of survival.  And what a survivor he must be----he lived to write this no-holds-barred experience of his life---obviously in the hope that it would be an inspiration to others.  I know, for it inspired me.  Something this [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K, this perfect, and this human only comes along once in a lifetime.  Grab it while you can. You're in the presence of genius---pure, simple . . . genius. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Almost every culture, from ancient times to the present, has been infected with this philosophy. His book covers its history from Biblical times to the late 20th Century.  The first two thirds look at Europan and western attitudes, and how they contributed to the holocaust and have changed since World War II.  The final third examines the Islamic world and the present conflict over Israel.  This last section is in many ways the most interesting, as it covers material many in the West may be less familiar with.<br /><br />  The [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest weakness here is that while the author gives us many facts, he offers very little in the way of explanation.  We learn almost nothing about why antisemitism has been so prevelant or so intense, or why, like a natural disaster, it flares up in cycles every so often.  No one expects Wistrich to have the final answer here, but he should have made at least some attempt to discover the reasons for the 'longest hatred'.	2005-10-13

Actually one of Cartland's shorter (and less substantive) novels, it remains my favorite.  There is such a sweetness to the heroine Anita, and all the characters are worth meeting. <br /> <br />Our story in short:  Anita and her two older sisters have been virtually left on their own.  Their mother has traveled to Switzerland due to her illness.  We meet her briefly.  Sarah, the oldest sister has written to all their relatives, some of whom are \\"quality.\\"  They, of course, are penniless relations even though they are of good birth.  Sarah ends up with a Countess for a season, Daphne ends up with her godmother who is also kind to her but Anita ends up with an old maid [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K aunt with endless \\"charitable\\" works. I DO think the sisters seemed very selfish leaving poor Anita to struggle with the worst possible relation!   <br /> <br />Before Anita goes on her journey to the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K-aunt, she meets Kerne, the Duke of Ollerton, at a gate while he is out riding.  It is a momentous meeting as Anita in her fanciful way thinks he looks like the fallen angel Lucifer (and tells the Duke this) and Kerne remarks on some obscure poem that Anita actually knows.  He thinks she looks like a tiny angel.  They are to meet again and sooner than he thought. <br /> <br />Kerne has asked his mother to set up a house party so he may select a wife.  His career requires it!  His future duchess must be tall, statuesque, blonde - and on and on.... and his mother invites three eligible women to his home.  Both the Duke and Duchess (his mother) meet Anita at the pumps in Harrowgate and later, Kerne thinks of a way to save her from an unsavory marriage to an old man (her [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K-aunt's \\"pet\\" parson as they referred to him.). <br /> <br />Anita ends up at the Ollerton estate with the Duchess.  Her charming manner soon makes her popular to the household.  She is so open and fresh.  Later when joined by Kerne and his guests, even they find her delightful.  One guest, Lord Greshem finds her a little too delightful!  The events at the house party, from balls to early morning rides to a misunderstanding between Kerne and Anita is wonderfully portrayed.  You really are not sure how it will all work out.  And does it?  Can Anita really say no when the Duke asks her to marry him?  And why would she - read this lovely book and you will find out the answer.  <br /> <br />Why a five for this book?  I judged it against others like it.  It does not have an extended storyline or detailed character development of longer Regency novels, but there is something in this one that touches my heart.  I think if you are looking for a quick read with mild villainy, you will enjoy this!   <br />	2005-10-13

He finds [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K success academically until he is awakened by a rebellious and free-spirited friend, who makes him rethink his drive to succeed on someone else's terms.  This story seems to be going somewhere- as the boy falls out of the academic system he ultimately finds some new satisfaction in manual labor and finds a second chance to experience childhood.  However, the story ends in a melodramatically tragic way, without exploring the boy's conflict in any real depth.<br /><br />Hesse makes some insightfully cutting remarks about academia's taming of young genius \\"like a jungle... cleared and its growth thwarted,\\" and manipulation of students as vessels to store teachers' ideas.  However, Hesse just as often gets distracted in irrelevant details and overly brief development of flat characters.<br /><br />This is certainly not near at the level of Hesse's best works, though this is still early in his career (1906).  Also, though there are thematic comparisons to Catcher in the Rye, this is an otherwise very reserved and repressed writing style typical of its time.	2005-10-13

The short stories and the central narrative were originally intended to be separate works, but he just decided to combine them.  This helps explain why most of the short stories don't really have much of anything to do with anything else in the book.  It's funny, I think this book would have been better received if it had just been a collection of short stories, cause now people are looking for things that aren't even supposed to be there. (Such as how you don't know any of the characters.  That falls into the 'true but irrelevant' category.)  Personally, I think it works best this way, and the central narrative wouldn't work nearly as well on its own, even though the stories would. (And, the stories themselves are already by far the better part.)  Still, it all ends up connecting well enough simply because of the stylistic and thematic similarities throughout the book. (i.e. violence, gross-out, death, perversion, world turned upside down, minimalist writing style etc.)  The central story is not particularly fascinating, but I think it works pretty well as a bridge between the individual stories.  If you think of it as a novel it doesn't work too well, but as a series of interludes I think it's pretty effective.  It's got some of the most gruesome-funny moments in any of his novels, and presents a nice microcosm for one of the central themes of the book. (Violence and destruction are central to human nature.)  But anyway, you just need to understand, coming in that this is primarily a collection of short stories, rather than a novel.  Most people still won't be pleased with this, as the novel is the preferred genre of the age, but I've always been a short story man, so it's perfect for me.<br /><br />Fortunately, the stories are generallly excellent, and always interesting.  'Guts' is nearly as disgusting as advertised, no small feat.  'Slumming' and 'Footwork' are two classic examples of reality turned upside down. (The first is about wealthy socialites who moonlight as homeless people, the latter about the use of New Age medicine/therapy for unseemly and destructive purposes.)  'Swan Song' is a predictable but gut wrenching tale of the media's obsession with self-destruction. 'Dog Years' is an amusingly perverse sick joke which cannot be specifically described with out giving it away. 'Civil Twilight' is one of the very best stories, about an unknown, unseen destruction falling down on the city, and the sort of paranoia and hysteria that follows.  It's perhaps the most horror-oriented story of the collection, and opens with some wonderful Lovecraftian ideas, even if the explaination proves to be more mundane. 'Speaking Bitterness' is an unnerving story of an encounter between a group of scarred, disturbed women and a supposed transsexual.  'Hot Potting' is told as an old-fashioned ghost story, with some truly haunting imagery.  The heart of the book is found in the 4 story series from Mrs. Clark, primarily about the slow death of her daughter Cassandra.  'The Nightmare Box' is probably my favorite story in the book, about a, well, Nightmare Box that permanently warps anyone who looks in it.  I'll admit, the central conceit of that story isn't particularly [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K, but it's a perfect display of the slow build up to the revelation of what actually is inside the box.  'Obsolete' is the final story of the book, and is another one which can't be described at all with out giving it all away.  It's a fun one though, and far different from what came before.  I suppose that's enough specifics.  None of the 23 stories is remotely close to bad.<br /><br />The book has a number of poems in it.  None of them are particularly remarkable, but they're short enough that they don't really detract, and provide a nice transition to the short stories.  Also, there are a number of nice lines and images spread out through them.<br /><br />Palahniuk's critics love to dismiss his work as 'adolescent', a classic way to denigrate a work with out actually making an argument. (And Palahniuk's not an adolescent, nor is he an idiot, so this argument doesn't do much, even if it actually meant anything in and of itself.)

So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \\"Nautilus\\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.<br /><br />I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo's story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn't matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added.	2005-10-13

I developed this interest in my early teens at a time when the country I was living in was going through massive changes. One of the things I learned during this time was that the truth is often hard to come by when studying history particularly when you are living it. What I thought was truth turned out not to be so true and at the same time lies abounded from the other side. When it comes to the life of Nelson I have read much and although my interest today is still the Victory I decided to find a decent biography of Nelson to add to my library. Roger Knight has, in my opinion, told the truth about Nelson in the most complete way I have ever come across in a very easy to read style and backed up by a prolific bibliography. Two thirds of the book is the biography of Nelson and the rest consists of a chronology of Nelson's life, notes on the people in his life, notes about the ships he sailed in and a glossary. Roger Knight dispels some of the myths that have grown up about Nelson but does not detract from the outstanding leader of men that Nelson was. Nelson's failings are not glossed over in favor of his [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kness as some have tended to do. Knight has not belittled Nelson to the point of saying that the battle of Trafalgar was nearly lost because of his vanity. Nelson was human like the rest of us, and this book shows the life of a true leader who overcame his weaknesses be they moral, personal or physical to rise above the norm and excel. This book was written to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar and is, as far as I am concerned, the most balanced story of the life of Nelson there is.	2005-10-13

Sure, we know that death is inevitable for us all somewhere far off in our wished-for future. So we draw up wills and provide for the \\"rainy day.\\" And we expect that there will be a process called \\"grieving.\\" But as my own late mother used to say, repeating the Irish wisdom, \\"We'll deal with it when we have to.\\" <br /> <br />THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING by Joan Didion is her memoir of what she went through in dealing with the unthinkable. On December 30, 2003, Didion and her husband, writer John Gregory Dunne, returned home from the hospital where their only daughter, Quintana Roo, lay in a coma, suffering from severe pneumonia and septic shock. While sitting down to dinner, Dunne had a massive fatal heart attack. They were 31 days shy of their 40th wedding anniversary. <br /> <br />Didion begins this book with the simplest of words: \\"Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The question of self-pity.\\" <br /> <br />Quintana would spend 24 days in intensive care after her father's death. Two months later, she collapsed and was rushed into surgery after developing a life-threatening hematoma on her brain. (Sadly, Quintana passed away from an abdominal infection in August. Asked by the New York Times if she would change the manuscript to include her daughter's death, Didion replied, \\"It's finished.\\") <br /> <br />Two such catastrophic events happening almost simultaneously would be enough to test the endurance of anyone. And, indeed, Didion writes that this period \\"cut loose any fixed idea that I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity,about life itself.\\" <br /> <br />Writers write. It is the way we decode and make sense of that which often does not make sense. Didion explains, \\"In time of trouble, I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature. Information was control.\\" <br /> <br />She discovered that the literature on grief, going back to Freud in 1917, is relatively sparse for such a universal ordeal. When told at the hospital that her husband was dead, a social worker described her reaction as being that of a \\"cool customer,\\" as if that was somehow reassuring. Didion writes, \\"I wondered what an uncool customer would be allowed to do. Break down? Require sedation? Scream?\\" <br /> <br />What followed for her was a year of magical thinking, an attempt to change the narrative by an act of will. She couldn't throw out John's shoes simply because he would need them when he came back. \\"Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it,\\" she writes. \\"We do not expect to be literally crazy, cool customers who believe that their husband is about to return and need his shoes.\\" <br /> <br />Memory turned into a \\"vortex\\" that could suddenly sweep her away. And here we find Didion's powerful descriptive writing and superb eye for detail. She drives past an LA movie theater and suddenly it was 1967, and she and John are at the premiere for The Graduate. Or she recalls buying her \\"short white silk\\" wedding dress in San Francisco at the exact same time that JFK was being assassinated in Dallas.  <br /> <br />Didion, author of five novels and seven works of nonfiction, is one of America's [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest writers and essayists. Her two collections of essays about the 1960s, SLOUCHING TOWARDS BETHLEHEM and THE WHITE ALBUM, are essential reading for anybody who wants to understand how America came apart during that turbulent decade. They also should be read by anyone interested in good writing and journalism. Didion is a true master of the craft. <br /> <br />THE YEAR OFMAGICAL THINKING is Didion at her best, covering her most painful story. And she answers \\"the question of self-pity\\" by not engaging it. It is impossible not to feel overwhelming sadness after losing the person you loved and spent virtually everyday with for 40 years. But she brings to her loss her journalistic honesty and the ability to search for and find the deeper truth, no matter how unsatisfying that truth may be. <br /> <br />And in so doing, she not only manages to liberate herself from her year of magical thinking but also to provide something of a guide for the rest of us as well. In addition to being a wonderful memoir, this book is an invaluable meditation for that time when the far-off future suddenly becomes now and the rainy day turns into a deluge. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Tom Callahan	2005-10-13

For one thing, the writing style is clean, even old-fashionably elegant, and Trench's scholarly approach to using previously published material on the subject is beyond reproach, being thorough and levelheaded throughout.  <br /> <br />That said, just what is the book about? Trench takes on the daunting task of establishing the reality of both the Lost Continent of Atlantis AND the existence of a world hidden in the hollow core of the earth, exactly as the title implies. After patiently making his case for the historical, real world existence of the two legendary locations, he moves on in a third section to discuss the kind of being he speculates may live in the \\"bowels of the earth.\\" <br /> <br />Trench primarily contends that Atlantis did indeed exist some 9000 years before Plato made reference to it in ancient Greece. When the super-advanced residents of Atlantis saw disaster coming, the exact nature of which of course remains unknown, they began to dig tunnels beneath the earth and to migrate east and west in hopes of escaping. While they were for the most part wiped out, the tunnels and some of their machinery remained behind and were used by the survivors to create a habitable world inside the earth, lit by an internal sun while being topographically the opposite of the surface world. For instance, what would be mountains topside are stalagmites hanging from the ceiling instead for those who dwell below.  <br /> <br />Along the way, Trench offers up a wealth of factual data to support his claims. One learns about the cover-up alleged to have been perpetrated by the government regarding Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who very likely discovered a warm, hospitable stretch of land in the Arctic North, as well as an entrance to a world inside the earth that has since been shrouded in official secrecy. The book includes a series of photographs of a large dark hole where the North Pole should logically be seen, taken during a series of NASA satellite over-flights in the late 1960s. This reviewer must admit that the photos look pretty darn convincing. Is the hole the entrance to that fabled subterranean world? This inner world may also be the home base of the countless UFOs that have been sighted repeatedly throughout human history, according to Trench.  <br /> <br />Trench also calls on the late, [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K Raymond Palmer to shore up his arguments for the existence of an official government \\"clamp-down\\" on information about the secret entrance to the inner earth, as well as the work of Richard Shaver, who claimed to be in contact with two races of people who lived in the hidden world. One of those races, the Dero, formerly occupied the surface of the earth until upheaval and calamitiy forced them to move underground to survive. They have since degenerated into a state of madness and sadism and use their superior technology--machines that are a remnant of the Atlantean scientific know-how--to torture and confuse us surface dwellers, even to the point of causing warfare and genocide among us. As an explanation for the wickedness of human history, this one is as good as any.  <br /> <br />Brinsley Le Poer Trench was also the Earl of Clancarty and a distinguished member of the House of Lords. Until his death at the age of 83 in 1995, he campaigned tirelessly to get the British Crown to open its files on the UFO phenomenon, and would regularly schedule lectures by UFO experts from around the world held there in the Parliament building in London. Trench continues to be sorely missed by all who knew him, and this Global Communications reissue of \\"Finding Lost Atlantis Inside The Hollow Earth\\" is a worthy part of his lasting legacy.	2005-10-13

The following five chapters are dedicated to a specific movement of the work. \\"Mythologiques\\" is mainly concerned with the source text for the first movement, drawn from Levi-Strauss. \\"O King\\" details the structural properties of the pitch set and the rhythmic set, and the selective resonance of the second movement. For the discussion of the third movement, readers will want to obtain a copy of the score of Berio's work, as Osmond-Smith catalogues the numerous quotations according to the rehersal number they are found in. Osmond-Smith explains the \\"obliteration as form\\" that makes the use of the Mahler quotation so idiosyncratic. The fourth chapter treats the fourth and fifth movements together. Discussion of the fourth movement is very brief, only two pages, but the fifth is exhaustively covered.<br /><br />When I first got a copy of \\"Sinfonia\\", I could relate easily only the zany third movement, which is quite accessible.

When one looks over the vast array of American Literature, there are but a few books that are ranked in a class by themselves.  They include such novels as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"The Jungle\\".  In any \\"[01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest list\\" I've seen, \\"Moby Dick\\" always shows up.  In fact, only Huckleberry Finn draws more support as the Great American Novel.  With this in mind, I decided that it was high time I read \\"Moby Dick\\".  In doing so, I was prepared to appreciate a classic with my only misgivings being my tendency to get bogged down in the tedium of the 19th Century style of prose.   <br /> <br />I admit that I was fairly satisfied with the first part of the novel and I was proceeding along fine until Ismael turned into the world's [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest authority on the subject of whales and whaling.  I may have missed a point or two but I was sure that Ismael's self-introduction identified him as a merchant marine who was embarking on on his first whaling voyage.  He must have been doing a lot of reading on the voyage because he proceeded to tell me more that I ever wanted to know about whales and whaling. <br /> <br />I read \\"Moby Dick\\" to enjoy a story; not to engorge myself with, for me, uninteresting trivia.  The facts overwhelmed the story and I was losing interest fast.  I finally started to speed read my way through the final 50 pages and all of the accompanying \\"Billy Budd\\".  I have seldom been so happy to finish a book and I even entertained the thought of just chucking the book and not even finishing it.  I realize that there are many thousands of people out there for whom the sea is an enchantress.  I also understand that Captain Ahab's maniacal search for the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K white whale has allegoties about ourselves (although I wasn't all that motivated to dwell on that subject). <br /> <br />\\"Moby Dick\\" is not the first classic to fall short in my estimation and I'm sure it won't be the last.

Finally, we learn that \\"psychopath\\"  is \\"sociopath\\" now, among professionals.   And I liked that he reminds us that  the \\"perfect\\" person,  marriage, family, the \\"perfect\\" anything is  a fiction.  When someone is held out to be \\"perfect,\\" especially by their family, it can be horribly debilitating, to say the least.  It was also chilling to realize that there are emotional \\"vampires,\\" feeding off others' life blood so they can mimic being human.  Still - I've always had more faith in nature than nurture.  I believe Peterson was born with a predilection to be a sociopath...and to kill.   I've known and counseled people with far worse lives than Scott Peterson's - and they've gotten help and gone on to be good and caring.  The abused, the neglected, the \\"unloved,\\" who should be among the walking dead, but who've refused to let their pasts keep them from  finding and giving love - many have made life work for them wonderfully despite extreme deprivation. Some don't make it, I realize that.  I suppose Peterson is one of them.  But still - murder is the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest taboo. You have to be pretty \\"bent\\" from the get-go to do it.	2005-10-13

US	14898173	RXEYMUO0G84G4	067082982X	877287899	The Dark Half	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Pat's review - [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book	A novel about the struggle between a man and his \\"dark half.\\" Writer, Thad Beaumont, decides it's time he puts a rest to his pen name \\"George Stark.\\" In a strange series of events, you find out that George Stark has come to life. The story alternates between George's view and Thad's view throughout their struggle to destroy each other. <br /> <br />This book, for me at least, was for the most part not too difficult a read. Stephen King has [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K diction. Some of the words he uses to describe things are extremely effective. These words give the book that extra edge in creating a suspenseful (and often times gruesome) situation. The novel is also one that you don't want to put down. In fact, in the prologue starts you with a little taste of what is to come in the rest of the book. In those first 10 pages you just know that you have to find out what it has to do with the story. You must be warned though, this book is not for those who are faint of heart or have a weak stomach, it's quite graphic. Another interesting thing King does is he splits up the book not only into chapters but also what could be considered two \\"acts.\\" Before and after each act are parts from the stories that the characters in the book have written. This really gives you a good sense of the contrast between the characters and how each of their minds work. Also, once you get a little ways into the book you are now working with two points of view, that of Thad and that of George. This again gives you a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K sense of what is going on. Once the two characters are both introduced into the book they are far apart. As the story progresses they gradually come together and their stories meet. Stephen King has an impeccable ability to keep you interested in what will happen next, even in the down time when nothing thrilling is happening.	2005-10-13

This is an absolutely fascinating book that I read over the course of about 2 days while flying to Europe last summer.  I've always found Mormonism to be a scary and bizarre religion, founded by a man as an excuse to marry as many women as possible.  This book pretty much confirmed this belief.  The Mormons still refuse to face the brutal beginnings of their religion and I doubt any who wrote reviews here actually read the book, they were probably told to come here and denigrate the book by their local sect.  The Mormons would still be practicing polygamy today if it weren't for their [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker desire to have their own state.  Lest you think I'm uninformed, I work in a community with a large LDS following and much of what Krakauer writes is similar to what I've witnessed.  I have a good friend at work who was forbidden to attend his own son's wedding because he \\"converted\\" to marry a Mormon girl.

One thing about this author: he can be amusing, wicked, and pedagogic at the same time, and he spouts forth words almost like a non-extinct volcano. How does he do it?! Here he mildly critiques such academic, rambling authors like Iris Murdoch, while writing in awe of the legendary literary busyness of John Updike. His appreciation of Bellow for his non stop exuberance, and Nabokov for his extreme wordplay may be overdone, but nonetheless well worth the read. The best pieces may be of Anthony Burgess, the rollicking, phantasmagorical Brit, especially his review of the Burgess autobiography. He admits Joyce's ULYSSES is not a \\"straight thru\\" read, a comment which perfectly matches my thoughts, but plows thru this hefty tome with [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K style and aplomb!

You read war books and there are always characters that aren't afraid to die, and are unemotional. All of these \\"heroes\\" get lost in the endless list of different characters commiting the same acts. But this book is different. Perry is a person from Harlem, and you can relate to him. He does get scared when he goes into battle, and he doest not take comfort in killing. It is refreshing to read this because it has a way of comforting us. I know that i am not the only one that has thought about how i would act if i ever went to war. Society puts a pressure on you to be some sort of hero, but this book kindly reminds you that it is the normal soldiers that are hero's.  <br />  The other thing i like about this book is the message that it sends to me as a reader. It has a strong sense of brotherhood and puts an emphasis on the comforts of home. Throughout the book the men are counting down the days until they leave Vietnam. Not only do the soldiers care about when they leave, they care about when others leave. When Perry's commandor is only weeks away from leaving, the platoon comes together to protect him so that he can go home. THe book also puts an empahsis on the comforts of home. There are flashbacks frequently in the book showing the things that each soldier missed about homes, things that we often take for granted. <br />The book is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K read and i recomend it to anyone that loves a good book.	2005-10-13

This is the long-awaited second edition of Fletcher & Rossing.  Note first that it really is a reference work, not a teaching text.  There is no lesson plan, no problems, no solutions manual, no accompanying workbook  Except for the first two foundation sections on vibrating systems and sound waves, there is no ongoing development.  Nothing builds.  It's just one topic piled on another.   <br />       But the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K merit of reference works is that you can cherry-pick, i.e. seek information on isolated topics with little concern for what preceded them.  As a reference work, F&R get the highest possible marks from me.  They are clearly the masters of this field, not least because of their numerous important contributions to it.  With the possible exception of the works of Arthur Benade, they own the business.   <br />       Despite its enormous size and [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K depth of coverage, however, it is not an encyclopedic study of musical instruments.  It is exactly what the title says: a work on the PHYSICS of musical instruments.  A rigid boundary has been drawn between physics and every other aspect of music-making.  In particular, psychoacoustics is totally ignored.  There are no entries in the index under loudness, Fletcher-Munson, combination tones, false bass, consonance, dissonance, etc.  Even equal temperament tuning gets little more than one page out of 756. <br />       The Preface says the work is addressed to \\"the reader...who is not frightened by a little mathematics.\\"  Well, some of the math is \\"little\\" but some of it is not.  See for example the use of Green's functions to find the air load on a vibrating membrane, pp. 588-590.  Perhaps at MIT, where incoming freshman are sorted out by the do-or-die killer course in mathematical physics from Morse & Feshbach, these methods are taught to undergrads, but not at most other schools.  Almost everywhere else this would be considered first-year graduate material.  These pages would not only frighten the averagereader; they frighten me.  I always hated Green's functions and considered it part of my mission in life to prune them away wherever they grew. <br />     There are a few typos, mislabeled equations and the like.  The next-to-last sentence of text on p. 232 says, \\"This is an adquate approximation provided the sound wavelength is small compared to the transverse dimensions of the ducts and cavities involved.\\"  Surely \\"small\\" should read \\"large.\\" <br />       In sum, not for beginners, and probably not for most musicians either.  But within its compass it reigns supreme.  There is no better book in this field.     <br />  <br />	2005-10-13

There are simply too many of them. Christopher Kennedy Lawford distinguished himself by becoming a soap opera star, appearing on \\"All My Children\\" through the 1990s, a happy time for him because he was working steady and staying sober. He has proven himself to be a competent, if somewhat wordy, writer in this fast-moving memoir. <br /> <br />Alcoholism is clearly the curse of the Kennedy clan, and Lawford came by it honestly, from his mother Pat Kennedy, who was unwilling or unable to acknowledge her own ghosts, and his father Peter Lawford, a handsome, hard-working actor, a hard-living Hollywood animal and \\"womanizing spendthrift\\" (as his ex-wife later characterized him). Peter had a suave English accent and \\"bedroom eyes\\" that he passed on to his son, and he used his charms to bed most of the beauties in his circle. It was a circle that included the hottest babes of the day. Peter was a charter member of the infamous Rat Pack and a regular at Hugh Hefner's mansion. At one point in his adolescence, Lawford recalls, \\"My dad was entertaining some mates from England --- John Lennon, Ringo Starr and Mick Jagger. Yeah, this will work.\\" <br /> <br />So Lawford grew up surrounded by the brightest stars that Hollywood was spitting out in the latter half of the 20th century, as well as the kings and king-makers whose power ebbed and flowed through Washington. He was closer than a kid ought to be to the Cuban Missile crisis and the Civil Rights movement. And he was in the bosom of a family torn apart twice by bullets and violent, senseless death. As he puts it, \\"Having a family member killed definitely messes with your sense of safety. What I realize now about my uncles' assassinations is that the massive outpouring of collective grief and goodwill toward the family obscured the underlying realization that there were people in the world who wanted to blow our f---ing heads off.\\" Very likely, too, the public process prevented private grieving, compelling the Kennedys to act more courageous than they felt, and less emotional. <br /> <br />Lawford and many of his cousins reacted by wilding. When you have access to wealth and plenty of pull, the fences are few. The drugs that they indulged in were common for the niche of society they ran with, and testing the limits in the underbelly of commerce, dealing with the dealers, just made the game more exciting. Busts and bail, repeated exercises in forgiveness and failure, were par for the course. When his beloved cousin David died of an overdose, a distant alarm bell went off in Lawford's fogged consciousness. But it took years to pull himself back from the brink. <br /> <br />You can't feel too sorry for a kid who had every chance, every privilege, and who continually blew it, and it's fair to say that Lawford asks for no sympathy. He recounts his own fall into disgrace and ruin with gallows humor. He rejoices in his one [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K success: becoming sober --- something his father never achieved. However, the book is ridden with self-congratulation thinly disguised as self-criticism. When Lawford left his wife he called himself all sorts of names, but had to add this small bit of back-talk: \\"even if a woman gets everything she wants in a marriage, if a man leaves, past history is rewritten and suddenly it is she who sacrificed her life so he could live his dream.\\" <br /> <br />SYMPTOMS OF WITHDRAWAL unmasks the Kennedy legend only to a limited extent. The author (or the publisher?) takes advantage by, for example, using a cover shot of Lawford as a kid with his famous Uncle Jack rather than with either less-recognizable parent, even as the book claims to mock the iconography of Kennedy Clanship. Lawford is perhaps overly kind to Uncle Ted, whom he calls Le Grande Fromage, and one suspects some patronage issues there. The Kennedy whom Lost Boy Christopher most admired, it seems, was his Uncle Bobby, arguably the best candidate forPresident of his generation. He also speaks highly of Aunt Eunice, allowing us to recall that there were, hidden off-stage, a number of Kennedys whose lives took a different course, who reached out to others (especially the mentally and physically handicapped), acted with discretion, stayed reasonably sober, and sought no limelight. <br /> <br />Many will find this book --- grand in its scope as Lawford marches all over the map of his culture and the events current --- a satisfying read. Others will be left with questions, though these questions are perhaps inappropriate to the medium. All the guy is trying to do, for heaven's sake, is write about himself, and in that he succeeds. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott <br />	2005-10-13

I did not find the suggestions to be any cheaper than what I was purchasing myself beforehand.  There were some solutions she suggested that worked okay, but I found I was trying too many products, spending more money and not getting the good results stated in the book. <br /> <br />Examples: She says to \\"cleanse\\" before doing certain things like exfoliate - she does not address cleansing. <br /> <br />She suggests that \\"exfoliating\\" will help with the removal of blackheads - but doesn't tell how to remove the blackheads from the face safely without bruising or scarring the skin. <br /> <br />After reading the book I came away with only one or two remedies that worked.   <br /> <br />I would not have purchased this book if I had known the above. <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Give him Different Seasons	For all those who doubt the fact that Stephen King is one of the all-time [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K masters at the craft of writing, there is Different Seasons.  If nothing else, the doubters should at least acknowledge King's important contribution to reviving the lost art of the novella.  King has always said he would write, whether he ever sold a single book - and I think that is completely true.  He didn't write these four novellas with publication in mind; each one was written immediately after the completion of a best-selling novel - and each one just sort of sat there after it was finished.  What, after all, can a modern author really do with manuscripts too long to be short stories and too short to be novels?  Eventually, the idea came to King to just publish them together, with a title that speaks to the fact that these are not the author's usual blood-dripping, creepy-crawling horror stories.  In doing so, he not only gave us four of his most captivating works of fiction, he showed a whole new generation of readers the vast, inherent power of the novella.<br /><br />Three of these four novellas are even better-known than many of King's best-selling novels - due in no small part to the movie adaptations that followed in their wake.  It all started with the film Stand By Me - which was not marketed as an adaptation of a Stephen King work of fiction.  This was a smart move, considering some of the weak adaptations of earlier King novels.  I can only guess how many impressed moviegoers were shocked to learn that Stand By Me was adapted from King's novella The Body.  It's a story of four boys who set off to see a dead body, that of another kid hit by a train; their adventure makes for an extraordinary coming-of-age story.  It is, in fact, a story about childhood, founded upon a mysterious event in King's own early days (he supposedly saw a friend hit by a train when he was four years old - but there has always been some question as to whether or not this is true); The Body feels autobiographical, and it truly does recapture the essence of childhood and the maturing process into adolescence.  I like to think of The Body as a fantastic warm-up to King's later novel It, which captures the essence of childhood almost perfectly.<br /><br />Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption gave birth to Shawshank Redemption, the most critically acclaimed and popular of all King movie adaptations.  I think the movie is even better than the novella (largely due to Morgan Freeman), but everything that shines in the movie is here in the novella.  An innocent man, convicted of killing his wife and her lover, gives new meaning to the term patient resolve - and has a profound effect on some of his fellow prisoners.  I think it's the ultimate prison story, as it shows us the good and the bad of prison life and imbues its characters with a humanity rarely seen in prison-based stories.  It's just a stellar piece of writing.<br /><br />Apt Pupil is my favorite, though, and it finally, after years of fits and starts and rumors, was made into a film in 1998.  The movie did make some changes to the original storyline, but it was a vastly underrated film that truly embodied the spirit of King's original novella.  The most horrible things can oftentimes be the most fascinating.  I know I've always been fascinated by everything that took place in the Third Reich.  The teenager in the story, though, is obsessed with those atrocities, and that obsession turns into something increasingly disquieting and dangerous when he discovers a former Nazi living under another name in his neighborhood and blackmails him into telling him all the \\"gooshy\\" details of his part in the Holocaust.  Apt Pupil is one of the most impressive psychological studies of evil I've ever read.<br /><br />The Breathing Method sort of gets lost in the shuffle.  It's shorter than the other novellas and has never been adapted for film.  I really like this story, though.  It has a classic fireside story feelto it, hearkening back to the likes of Poe, with its mysterious gentlemen's \\"club\\" and emphasis on story-telling.  The particular story we are privileged to hear about is in some ways rather ridiculous and certainly quite melodramatic - yet it works extremely well.  The novella was dedicated to Peter and Susan Straub, and I think it shows the obvious influence of horror maestro Straub from top to bottom (which, to my mind, is a good thing).<br /><br />The Breathing Method supplies the theme that serves as a sort of mantra for the entire collection: It is the tale, not he who tells it.  The story is everything, and the author is sort of a literary midwife who helps the birthing process along.  I heartily believe that many a King critic would fawn over Different Seasons if they read it without knowing who wrote it.  This book is a perfect introduction for those yet to experience King for themselves - these are, for the most part, mainstream works of fiction that reveal a master storyteller at work.ory feel to it, hearkening back to the likes of Poe, with its mysterious gentlemen's \\"club\\" and emphasis on story-telling.

However I, like many of the day to day users of the system, do not know how to access many of the neat tools available to Mac OS X Tiger users. I attend workshops and attend Apple User's Group meetings and I'm blown away by the knowledge and skills of some of our Apple users. The problem for me is that even though the tips or hacks given are [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K one does not use them enough to remember them several weeks later.  <br /> <br />Most publications that cover Apple applications have side bar graphics that draw the readers attention to a neat tip. However, what is really needed is a book that gathers these \\"Killer Tips\\" and put them in one resource organized in a manner that allows the reader/user access to the real power of Tiger. That is exactly what Scott Kelby's Mac OS X Tiger Killer Tips does.   <br /> <br />The book is well designed and the layout is pleasing. The tips contained in the book are the type that cause you to smile, nod and say \\"amen\\".  Do you want to know how to zip a file in Tiger, capture a page, keep your private data private? The books contains literally hundreds of truly killer tips and they are explained in a language and style that we all can understand.  Between the table of contents, index and content specific chapters the navigation of Tiger becomes achievable and the powerful secrets of Tiger are revealed. <br /> <br />This is one book that all Tiger users should have in their library.  However, it is especially beneficial to those users that would be considered intermediate users. I highly recommend Mac OS X Tiger Killer Tips - its like having a techie on call when you need to access one of those awesome Tiger tools or tricks.	2005-10-13

Books	5	57	58	N	N	Important Reading for Parents and Teens	Growing up Christian is not as easy a task as one might think. There are dangers and temptations unique to growing up within a Christian family and within the church and sadly these difficulties are often downplayed or misunderstood by those who have been converted later in life. Growing Up Christian seeks examine these issues, which, as a person who grew up in a Christian home (ie a \\"church kid\\"), are near and dear to my heart. The book is targetted primarily at church kids, though their parents would do well to read the book with them. The author, Karl Graustein, is a church kid himself and is now a principal at a Christian school, so is intimately aware of the issues at stake.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. The first lays out the blessings and the dangers of growing up in a Christian family. \\"Growing up in a Christian home is a wonderful privilege. We have been given so much: godly parents, training in the Word of God, friends from Christian homes, support from a Christian church community, and most importantly an opportunity to know God at a young age. Throughout our lives, we are repeatedly taught about the love of God, his plan of salvation, ways to recognize and resist sin, and living for the glory of God\\" (page 21). He goes on to recount other benefits of being raised in a Christian environment, pointing out that while we are given so much we are also protected from so many dangers.<br /><br />\\"Church kids face some unique challenges...Though surrounded by the things of God, we can still be drawn to sin and live double lives. We can easily assume that we are saved even if we are not; or we may be driven by a desire to be popular more than a desire to live according to biblical values. While it is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K blessing to grow up in a Christian environment, if we are not careful we can make some dangerous assumptions about ourselves, which have serious consequences\\" (page 22).<br /><br />I can testify from my life that I have seen both the privilege and the danger of growing up in a Christian home. I am ever thankful to God that He blessed me with discerning parents who, though they did not understand from their own experience what it is like to be a church kid, were unrelenting in sharing the gospel with us. Their efforts have been blessed as all five of their children know and serve the Lord. But as often as I have seen this type of blessing, I have seen the opposite, where the children of Christians fall away or live lukewarm at best, always assuming but never knowing that they are saved.<br /><br />The second section teaches kids how to think biblically. Graustein speaks of the importance of cultivating humility, of growing in gratefulness, of loving Scripture and of trusting God. He also covers what I might consider the most important topic in the book: developing personal biblical convictions. On the front cover of the book are the words, \\"Have you taken ownership of your relationship with God?\\" Just this weekend I was discussing this topic with my friend Doug and I suggested that this is exactly what the children of Christians need to do. For many years we coast along under the umbrella of our parents' faith. We do what they do and say what they say simply because that is what we have been taught. But there comes a time of crisis and decision. This is a time I remember from my own life. I do not know whether this is the moment I became a Christian or whether that was much earlier, but I do clearly remember the day that God allowed me to make my parents' faith my own. It was a day of transformation in my life. It is a day that I suspect all church kids have at some point.<br /><br />The final section deals with living biblically and the author discusses battling sin, the spiritual disciplines and stewardship of God-given talents. Much of this section draws upon and is consistent with the excellent teaching ministry of Don Whitney and his book Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life. Other clear influences on the author through this section and others are J.C. Ryle, John Piper, Jerry Bridges and C.J. Mahaney. Graustein is clearly a man who has spent much time in the Word and much time learning from sound teachers.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a fantastic book and one which I wish I had been able to read while I was a teenager still wrestling with my faith. To echo the endorsement of Tedd Tripp, \\"Karl Graustein gets it! He understands the pitfalls and dangers that track with the privilege of growing up in a Christian home. He addresses all the standard temptations...This book has a look and feel that young people will appreciate.\\" Growing Up Christian is a book I would unhesitatingly recommend to any and all Christian parents and teens.<br /><br />This is a bit unusual, but I'd like to make special mention of the person who designed the cover for this book. It is very well done and I suspect this book will sell quite a few copies to those who judge a book by its cover. Well done! If there are awards for this type of thing I hope you receive consideration.Other clear influences on the author through this section and others are J.C. Ryle, John Piper, Jerry Bridges and C.J.

It is quite out of date - it talks about placing ads in the newspaper and says that computer ads are brand new and too new to comment on. <br />I'll list lots of the contents to give you an idea of the specifics that this talks about: <br />The speaker has a good speaking voice and is a pretty good communicator but the actual content is very poor quality. Almost all of the content is the same as in his other books/audiobooks. (e.g. \\"how to be outrageously successful with the opposite sex) <br /> <br />He \\"proves\\" that your inner voice is wrong because he can teach you to remember a 32 digit number in 30 seconds. But his method for remembering them involves a complex story he tells. And if you can't remember the exact order of the story, you can't remember the number. He teaches you how to convert the story into the number, but without remembering the complex story, you won't remember the number. <br /> <br />step 1... how to find people: <br />- Men should volunteer at local community theatre since there would be 15 to 20x more women than men. <br />- Women should go to free real estate and business seminars - 30 to 40x more men than women <br />bachelor/bachelorette auction <br />- Talked for 3 whole minutes about a dating service meeting that 400 singles attended but cost $5000 to join and the singles could have met others while at the meeting for free <br />- Put together a free dating service with printed out flyers and get a choice of the best applicants to date <br />- Be in a power position - e.g. teach something - adult school, community college - cooking, karate, dancing, travel, nutrition, fitness, massage, etc. <br />- If you're a woman, teach single men to cook. <br />- Men can teach \\"romantic cooking\\" or \\"cooking for the single woman\\", etc. <br />- Use personal ads (is talkingabout newspaper ones - for $10-$20) <br />he says quite a few times that most people who use personal ads aren't \\"geeks, weenies, and losers\\" <br />He gives a template where you fill in some blanks for writing a letter to newspaper ads, and include an \\"action photo\\" e.g. photo of sweaty man from playing tennis, not professional headshots <br /> <br />\\"Formula for [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K personal ad\\" (main points) <br />- bold capital letter headline, centred on the first line <br />- Heading: \\"I love firefighters\\" \\"I'm looking for an attourney\\" \\"Are you Mr. muscle?\\" \\"I have a passion for redheads\\", etc <br />- Keep ad \\"light\\" <br />- eliminate all anger, hostility, etc, from ad (e.g. say \\"no smokers please\\" not \\"smokers don't even consider asking\\") <br />- men, say you want a woman \\"in shape\\" not \\"slim\\" <br />- don't say you're sophisticated, high cultured, high class <br />- if you have children, mention it <br />- don't give up <br />- be honest <br />- don't \\"i love puppy dogs, rainbows, walking in the rain\\" or \\"I like sports, cars, and girls\\" <br />- don't be boring saying \\"single white female, etc\\" <br /> <br />He says many times that he interviewed many people about dating tips for his research and it doesn't make sense that this is the best he could come up with. <br /> <br />Talks about voice ads - \\"use if you have no other choice\\", discourages video ads. <br />\\"computer ads - brand new, too new to comment on\\" <br /> <br />About [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K and awful places to go on a first date. <br /> <br />What not to say on a first date. <br /> <br />- women should send flowers ??? <br /> <br />- be enthusiastic but not too enthusiastic <br /> <br />- what thoughtful gifts to give, etc. <br /> <br />and some other basic tips about dating and relationships.	2005-10-13

Pi's creativity and strong will keeps the reader entranced and often surprised. Even in Part I, when the novel seems to be random tidbits about Pi's life, the little descriptions and short stories are creative and often humorous. However, I had thought that this book would, as it said, make me \\"believe in God.\\" Because I thought I was going to discover insight on God, I was disappointed. The majority of the book does not focus on religion or God at all. Even though Pi lives and that probably required God's help, a story like that should not be called one that makes you \\"believe in God.\\" If you do not expect to gain truths about God and wish to fall into a captivating story of a young boys fantastic survival, Li of Pi can fulfill, but it can not fulfill its promise of making \\"you believe in God.\\" I rated it a four because of this disappointment in its lack of fulfillment in its promise and for a lack of definite conclusion. I did find the twist at the end with the other version of Pi's story to be fascinating. I had accepted pretty much everything he had told us up until that point, and I thought it was [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K that Pi could have been making up/ imagining the animals and other things. To me that seems to be a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K coping mechanism for young Pi that helped him deal with the problems he faced. I do however wish that the author would not have left the book hanging with the reader wondering whether or not Pi's story with the animals was the one that really happened or the one with the humans. If the animal version was true, this would not necessarily make me \\"believe in God;\\" it would make me believe in the power of imagination.	2005-10-13

Whether you're an avid or new reader of IR romances this book is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K read.     The Bad:   1) The characters are A-typical or IR romances. Yvonne, the antagonist,is an emotionally broken, however, financially successful black woman who's been hurt in past realtionships. She meets the A-typical white male-also financailly successful, good looking, and also emotionally battered.     The Good:   1)While the characters are A-typical of IR romance novels, the characters have good depth. Each character displays a good range of feeling and emotions.   2)There romance is well written and develops over the story. You don't feel like they meet and immediately fall in love. It happens slowly and the author details it's development. The reader actually feels like they watched the relationship develop.  3)There is [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K sex. The sex scenes are steamy and slightly (well a little more than slightly) erotic. They are incredibly well written and form clear images for the reader.   4)Most importantly the race issue is handled incredibly well. The author deals with it without dwelling on it. Unlike some more expeirenced authors she doesn't allow the race issue to overwhelm the plot. The keeps the romance at the front of the story...which is refreshing.    Overall: This book was very well written and a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K read. I don't have buyer's remorse and feel as thought it was worth all of the eight dollars I spent buying it (there is a reason there are very few used copies). This is an author to keep you eye on.	2005-10-13

How apt what a sweet novel to take a final bow on if that is the intent. As seems to be the format of Hard Case True Crime an imprint of Liesure Publishing it is short and as others mentioned a quick read.   This story is perfect for King to exit with for a few reasons obvious to fans not so obvious to non-fans. It is [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K because as in his best works it has King traits throughout. For instance his characters are realistic and plausible in their humanity. In fact the Publisher of The Islander Vince Teague and his editor Dave almost echo some of King's own remarks on the subject of writing and story telling/reporting. Another trait in the best King fiction highlighted by this story is an open ended ending. The mystery is not totally solved. Life is full of unexplained incidents and mysteries and this is definitely a case of art imitating life. Here there is the unknown but both in its length and ploting this focuses on the everyday and realness of life. Making THE COLORADO KID, I repeat an excellent coda for King especially with its relative thematic stirrings raised in FROM A BUICK 8 and its accessablity to the casual reader/fan.    The last point I wish to raise in this review is a light rebuttal about the comments from reviewers critiquing the pacing of the story. In my not so humble point of view I think the pacing is dead on accurate and King is a master of pacing he has brought it up on his musings on the craft and I feel the pacing of this tale albeit slow makes instead of breaks the story.    PS I had to tack on one more observation why this series is suitable for King's publishing twilight and that is throughout his career he has been accused by some as being a \\"pulp\\" writer and he finally wrote a \\"pulp\\" fiction novel;)	2005-10-13

A novel of family, fun, bonding and discovery set in the 21st century in the United States. The story's <br />narration  from a 16 year old girl named Sib, helps to capture first hand experience of a mission to find truth <br />in a life that broke very early on while sharing it with her father. Sarcasm, music and adventure mix to <br />create an experience and story for any daddy's girl. Recommended age 16 and up due to mature themes and <br />understanding. <br /> <br />This is not a very difficult read. The story does, however, require a good understanding of personality in <br />order to pick up on the true essence of Sib and her sarcastic nature. Brooks' writing is very comical and <br />interesting, making sure for there to be an entertaining story or reference every chance possible. Throughout <br />the story, the reader gets an inside look into a music prodigy's life and her family life. The first 50 pages tell <br />of Sib's life as a teenager and the trials and tribulations that she's beginning to realize, only wanting to add <br />one more in meeting her mother. After page 50, the trip to San Francisco begins. Taxi, Sib's father, begins <br />to slowly discuss her mother and the life that she lead previously. Continuing to use a first person point of <br />view, Brooks develops the story using imagery and reflection on a life that Sib never knew. With the <br />development of character throughout the story, the reader begins to be able to understand the situation and <br />Sib. At the beginning of the story, Sib is very laid back and focused on her musical ambitions. Toward the <br />end of the novel music is still a main concentration, yet family and the interest within begin to eat away and <br />creep into Sib's curiosities. Taxi, in an interesting parallel, is very easy going and easy to talk to, reflected <br />in Sib and the way that her attitude is. The road trip discussions and ease of conversation between the two <br />characters rolls throughoutthe trip, showing signs of connection through music and family bonds. This <br />dialogue between the characters gives a more emotional element to the story. With his style of writing, <br />Brooks make a very large effort and accent on family bonds and the consistent necessity of family in your <br />life.	2005-10-13

My interest in him was peaked by talk of the \\"Other Murakami,\\" the dark reflection of award-winning popular novelist Murakami Haruki.  My first Ryu book, \\"Almost Transparent Blue,\\"  was a captivating tale of bottom-feeders and gutter-life in tune with Irvine Welsh's \\"Trainspotting\\" and William S. Burroughs's \\"Junky.\\"  This dirty little tale grabbed my interest and got me hunting for the next adventure.  And then \\"Coin Locker Baby\\" blew me away.<br /><br />Unlike the semi-autobiographical nature of \\"Almost Transparent Blue,\\"  \\"Coin Locker Babies\\" is a full-fledged novel, an unsettling fantasy firmly rooted in a grim reality.  Taking its title and beginning on an actual cultural phenomenon in Japan, that of unhappy mothers abandoning their new-born children in train station coin lockers,  Ryu then manifests a strange Japan, an amalgamation of anime-world and modern troubles.  It is a place where Tokyo harbors a corrupted and polluted abandoned city, called Toxitown, right in the middle of its most exclusive business district.  A place where a fashion model keeps a full-grown crocodile in her swampy apartment, and a hero's [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest ambition is to kill everyone and bring peace.<br /><br />Into this bizarro Japan Ryu introduces two boys, the only survivors of the coin-locker baby fad.  A bi-sexual popstar (Hashi) who is slowly being consumed by his fame, and a jockish pole-vaulter (Kiku) who seeks to unleash poison death and silence the world.  Each has an equally fitting lover: Anemone, a ethereal beauty who hunts for a Crocodile Heaven, and Neva, whose breasts having been lost to cancer makes her the perfect companion for the bi-sexual star.  These four wind their intertwining lives together, never quite admirable but somehow remaining sympathetic.  One does not know whether to root for their success or destruction.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Ryu's writing that he keeps the reader always on his/her toes, flitting between reality and fantasy, rarely giving something solid to hold on to.  Originally published in 1980, \\"Coin Locker Babies\\" is eerily prophetic of the 1995 Sarin Gas attacks on Tokyo from the Aum Shinrikyo Apocalypse cult.  Kiku's desire to unleash the toxin Datura rings a little bit too true after the fact.  The translation is flawless, with important cultural notes seamlessly blended, giving the Western reader much-needed clues on otherwise unfamiliar cultural practices.<br /><br />While not able to fully yield to his depressing reality, I am finding myself more attracted to the dark vision of the \\"Other Murakami.\\"  I am eager to see what else this amazing talent has to offer, and will definitely be checking out more novels as they are translated., flitting between reality and fantasy, rarely giving something solid to hold on to.

These corporate behemoths were able to rape the environment because their deep pockets had bought compliance among venal local officials, political influence from Texas to Washington, D.C., and their hiring power and big payrolls silenced the easily cowed.  <br />The only person they couldn't silence or buy off was Diane Wilson, whose story is a model of how to fight both city hall and Goliath and win, and is a tribute to her grit and pluck.    <br />But why the author laces her story with such graceless prose is puzzling, and why the publisher let her do it that way defies understanding. Listed on the copyright page are the names of a Chelsea Green editor, a managing editor, a copy editor, and a proofreader, all of whom presumably worked with this manuscript.  <br />Did none of them know that bad writing in a good cause is not nearly as effective as good writing in a good cause? Did none of them know that a double negative actually says the opposite of what the speaker intended and that, in any case, nothing is gained for any cause by a disingenuous use of clumsy and ignorant speech?  <br />Didn't they notice that Miss Wilson told the story of her fight in standard English, but the story of how she felt about the fight in another English altogether, one that sounded too ignorant to have come from the same person who told the first story? <br />Maybe not. Dust-jacket copy bills the book as \\"a novelistic tale,\\" and Chelsea Green's specialty is environmental activism, not fiction. Anyhow, here's a sampling of Ms. Wilson's writing that somehow passed muster with an intelligent writer and escaped an editor's pencil, too: <br />\\"Doomsday don't always stay doomsday.\\" <br /> \\"I had ran out of answers.\\" <br />\\"So the coffee got drank and a jarful of candy got ate . . . `  <br /> Then there's the just plain bad writing: <br />\\". . . panic clambered through my body worse than two babies running through the hall . . .\\" <br />\\". . . he wasn't no dandelion tiptoeing around the issues.\\" <br />\\". . . the sun laid a heavy hand on her hair.\\" <br />\\". . . his tone was still as feverish as a preacher with a message scribbled in his pocket.\\" <br />On the plus side, here's one of the few good ones: Describing oystermen who filed in after a long day at sea to sign her petition, Ms. Wilson wrote, \\"They looked tired-as if the wind and the cold had blown out the light in their eyes.\\"    <br />A similar cold front must have moved through the editorial offices of Chelsea Green Publishing Company in White River Junction, Vermont, while An Unreasonable Woman was being prepped for press. Green River (and Ms. Wilson) should stick to straight-forward reporting from the environmental front.  <br />True-life experiences can be novelized with [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K effect. Truman Capote and Norman Mailer proved that with, respectively, In Cold Blood and The Executioner's Song. But they didn't pick an ignorant-sounding narrator to tell the tale.	2005-10-13
US	26309919	R9C0IECUJW0RS	1592285570	702385650	Temple to the Wind: The Story of America's Greatest Naval Architect and His Masterpiece, Reliance	Books	5	10	10	N	N	I highly recommend this book.	Temple to the Wind is the next creative non-fiction hit.  As you can tell by the editorial reviews provided above, Temple to the Wind is comparable to Seabiscuit, Fastnet Force Ten, and In the Heart of the Sea.  It really is that good. <br /> <br />The story of Captain Nat and Charlie Barr has been told numerous times in books with an academic and dry approach.  I know because I've read most of them.  Pastore breaks from that trend and puts humor, suspense and in-depth research into a book that is obviously well researched and written.  Pastore's lifetime in the maritime world, combined with his academic approach and fluent writing style give the reader a story that has been told multiple times, but never quite like this.  Temple to the Wind, like Reliance, is a winner.    <br /> <br />What I especially like about Temple to the Wind is its lack of \\"fluff\\" writing.  Instead of using fabricated dialogue to embellish and give voice to the characters, Pastore mined the available material (including personal letters and diaries of Captain Nat and Sir Lipton) at the New York Yacht Club, Mystic Seaport, and Royal Ulster Yacht Club to create the tension and interaction between the characters. <br /> <br />From my experience sailing and racing on the restored J boats Shamrock and Endeavour, and my time spent in the yacht construction industry, I can say that Pastore has hit the nail on the head when it comes to recreating the construction and racing of the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K Reliance.  His description of the construction techniques used and the racing strategy are right on.  However, it needs to be stressed that Temple to the Wind does not read like a boat building manual or racing rules guide.  It is first and foremost a story about the characters that surrounded the boat. <br /> <br />For those of you who are unfamiliar with maritime terminology, don't worry, the extensive glossary provides accurate and understandable definitions and explanations.  The glossary also contains a helpfuland accurate illustration.   <br /> <br />Experienced sailors, armchair sailors, and history buffs alike, this book is either a perfect way to pass the winter months that are approaching or to enjoy while sitting at anchor next summer.   <br />	2005-10-13

Dr. Poland takes [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K pains to explain the minor actions that influenced not only the armies, but the two nations as well.  <br />     The battles are descibed in detail and set the stage for the following years of war in the Eastern Theater.  Much of the information concerning western Virginia (present day West Virginia) is usually absent or diluted in most modern accounts. <br />     Dr. Poland also examines the press accounts of this period in the war and contrasts the sentiments of the public in the North and South.  The book is well footnoted and gives many examples of newspaper coverage.  This is especially enlightening in the current climate of news coverage. <br />     The division of the conflict into the four invasion corridors makes the information easier to follow and allows the reader to better visualize the conflict.  This is important because the information is sometimes tedious by the nature of detailed troop movements. <br />     While this book and its detailed description of minor, athough fierce, battles may not hold the interest of the young or casual reader, it is a must for any student or buff of the Civil War in Virginia.  It is also good for those generally interest in Virginia/West Virginia history.  Attention to detail is required to read this, but it is that amount of detail that makes it worth it. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13
US	52849014	R2RM7NN38BSHN1	0940895072	365246507	Selling Satan: The Evangelical Media and the Mike Warnke Scandal	Books	5	29	31	N	N	Good Reading and Well-Researched	Unlike many of the reviews that I've read for this book, I read this book with an open mind. Even more than that, having personally been a Mike Warnke fan many years ago, I had noticed on my own that his stories do not line up. With that in mind, I sat down and sketched out many of the simple facts that do not add up. I encourage anyone with an interest in Mike Warnke to step past their own emotional responses and actually study Mike Warnke's words.<br /><br />For example, if you were to listen to all Mike Warnke's concert recordings and keep a journal of everything he claims, and then compare the notes from the individual recordings and the Satan Seller, you will quickly realize on your own that Mike's portrayal of his own life just is not possible. His story of his own life changes too [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kly over time. Additionally, the timeline of events as Mike describes cannot be accomplished on a calendar. Although some errors can be attributed to the passage of time and the possibility that a fact or two can be misplaced, the staggering number of incongruities that occur in Mike's own words are just too many to be shrugged off. After amassing such list of apparent mistakes on your own as I have suggested, sit down and read this book. You will see that not only does your list make sense and Mike's life does not, but you will be able to fill in many of the causations and backgrounds for the inconsistencies.<br /><br />I find it amusing, however, that the people who are accusing the writers of this book of dishonesty are also stooping to name-calling, and at the same time degrading the book's authors and promoters as name-callers. That's like saying, \\"Stop calling me names, you pooh-pooh head!\\" I understand that there are a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K number of people that loved Mike's public image in the past, and several people still do. This causes an emotional reaction to the truth, and that makes it almost impossible for some people to take. For example, most people have been around the Internet long enough at this point to have seen an Urban Legend or two. When you point out that someone has forwarded you an Urban Legend, there is an underlying realization by the sender that they have just been fooled. They become embarrassed, defensive, and sometimes deny the truth by trying to back up the story with allegations that the story was verified by other sources. There comes a time when you have to put aside your emotional reaction to a situation and just analyze the facts.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that one of the reviewers seems to base his assertion for Mike's innocence on a personal conversation that he had with Mike. Although I am not 100% sure, I feel that most people would be easily subdued by Mike if they spent an afternoon with him. That's part of Mike's recipe for success - his charisma is unmistakable. Like a skilled artist, Mike knows how to make you see \\"his\\" side of the story, regardless of any basis in fact.<br /><br />That being said, the accusation that Christians \\"shoot their wounded\\" is all-too-often true. If Mike had come forth and openly admitted that he had lied, asked forgiveness from those that he had offended, and the church still treated him as an outcast, then the church would be guilty of such a crime. But with Mike Warnke, the reverse is more the case. Mike has wronged a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K number of people, and yet he still maintains his innocence and claims to be the victim. (The closest that Mike has come to admitting any wrong-doing on his part was to assert that he had exaggerated slightly.)<br /><br />From having studied human behavior, there is an explanation to Mike's actions. Mike's stories and defenses seem to put him more in the category of a Pathological Liar and not a Compulsive Liar. For those of you that have never met a Pathological Liar, they are interesting people to know. Compulsive Liars simply tell lies for personal gain or self-preservation. They are aware that they are lying, but they can justify their behavior patterns to themselves. (This behavior is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.) Pathological Liars, on the other hand, tell lies for a myriad of reasons, but believe their lies as deeply as we believe the truth. Therefore, they can defend their lies with a zeal that parallels the defense of truth. Having personally known a few Pathological Liars in my lifetime, it is frequently hard to distinguish their truths from their lies. Because of this predisposition to dishonesty, Pathological Liars often lose the trust of everyone around. And unless they make an attempt to regain trust, they may never be trusted again. Mike Warnke's conduct suggests that he is not concerned with regaining trust, because he continues to assert that he never lied, even when faced with insurmountable evidence to the contrary. Because of this, Mike's behavior can only be categorized as unrepentant.<br /><br />This leaves us with a few questions and answers:<br /><br />Should the church reject Mike Warnke? Absolutely not.<br />Should Mike Warnke be forgiven? Yes.<br />Should Mike Warnke repent? Yes.<br />If Mike does not repent, should he still be forgiven? Yes.<br /><br />But the most important question: If Mike does not repent, and we have forgiven him as the Bible instructs, should he still be trusted?<br /><br />That answer, I'm afraid, is NO.r is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.)

The narrator, a drifter still married after six years but no longer living with his wife, encounters Tim (a Vietnam vet with a mean streak and strung out on drugs and booze most of the time) and his girlfriend Sylvia. The narrator becomes obsessed with Sylvia, though she keeps him at a distance out of mixed up loyalty to Tim (though he doesn't love or want her anymore, and she knows it).<br /><br />They concoct a plan to blow up a dam in the West, and the novel traces their actions in fulfilling this plan while contrasting the unrequited love interest the narrator has for Sylvia. Both plans are basically a disaster (Tim blows himself up along with the dam), and that's the irony in the story.<br /><br />Harrison makes these not very appealing characters interesting and worth watching as they proceed down their self-made road of doom. (That's where he failed in his first novel.) The narrative moves along to its conclusion powerfully, and we get swept up in it effortlessly. Harrison has [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K narrative skill; portraying these particular self-destructive anti-heroes locks the book into a specific time frame, however, that I hope he breaks out of in the future.	2005-10-13

The word ha'ole for example, has the root 'ha' meaning breath, and the word ole meaning without.  So the word used initially to describe missionaries that came to Hawaii, has the secondary meaning, those who pray without breath.<br /><br />Within this book is an explanation of the ha rite, which uses breath combined with prayer (intention) to generate mana which is sent to your higher self to manifest what you want in your life.  This is a very powerful technique.<br /><br />I have combined what I have gotten from this book and a few other sources, and using my intuition have come up with something very effective.<br /><br />The Huna commandment on page 72 is not to harm another.  So using this technique to interfere with someone's free will would not be appropriate.<br />If you do wish to focus on someone work for their highest good.

According to this system you would integrate all these aspects of self, and clear out the blocks or complexes within your lower self so you can manifest through your higher self.<br /><br />Further reading I recommend would be 'Mastering your hidden self' by Serge Sahili King, which also describes the Shamanic principles for creating your own reality.  These were life changing for me. I also highly recommend \\"Go up and work with God' by Vianna Stibal, a healer.  In that book she describes a manifesting ritual from her Huna studies.

Nothing could be further from the truth.  Antonin Artaud was a man interested in nothing less than the violent exhumation of real life from the cold, icy tomb that civilization has attempted to seal it in.<br /><br />As we see here in his letters to the sympathetic, but ultimately helpless Jacques Riviere, Artaud's suffered from a kind of hypochondria of the mind which resulted from his scorching intensity of thought.  He explicitly rejected happiness as the goal of human existence, and this is what separated him not only from the surrealists but from other thinkers of his age and ours.  Perhaps he put it best himself in his own strange, archaic language:<br /><br />\\"For nothing bestializes a being like the taste for eternal happiness, the search for eternal happiness at any price, and mademoiselle Lucifer is that slut who never wanted to abandon eternal happiness.\\"<br /><br />There will be nothing in this anthology that the Artaud admirer has not already seen, although the whole text (particularly the photographs of Artaud starring in Dreyer's \\"Joan of Arc\\" and Gance's \\"Napoleon\\"), comes together like a bizarre little work of art.  I have referred to it repeatedly, given it away, purchased it again.  The most important piece that this little publication has to offer is \\"I Hate and Renounce As a Coward\\"..., which is at the very end:the closest thing we have to a coherent philosophical position from Artaud.  Also, \\"Van Gogh:The Man Suicided By Society\\", which is more about Artaud than Van Gogh, gives us an indispensable glimpse into the psyche of the genuinely tortured, doomed artist.<br /><br />There are moments in which Artaud becomes as important in his commentary on the human condition, as thinkers like Nietzsche, Plato, Pascal, and all of the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ks.  Unlike in their work, though, it is not maintained consistently.  This is also the case with his poetry.  His internal anguish did not allow him to consummate his enormous potential.  His value lies in the threat he poses to our complacency simply by virtue of his memory.<br /><br />Read \\"The Theatre And It's Double\\" first, and then tear through this.  Savor Artaud's sentences as you would a delicate meal you'd never tasted before.<br /><br />May the looming shadow of this demented renaissance man never stop haunting us.ently.

I first learned of Alan Alda's book when he appeared on the ABC news show 20/20 last month. He was talking about his mother and her mental illness. I'm a long-time fan of Alda and I was fascinated about the story he told the interviewer. I ordered the book, eagerly anticipating a really good read. I was rather disappointed. <br /> <br />I won't go though all the things others have said here. But, I will say that, for a man who's written many television scripts and screenplays for movies, Alan's book could have been better. <br /> <br />While reading, I was struck with the feeling that Alda seemed to want to tell the reader more but he held himself back. There are many places in the book where he introduces a topic and then, in the next sentence, he changes the subject. Why? This is confusing. Either write more about the topic or take the sentences out.  <br /> <br />In the chapter about M*A*S*H, the writing improved a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal. The tone of the writing was much more relaxed. Alda seemed more connected to what he was writing about. The 'tension' I felt in the writing was gone. The chapter about his surgery was also well done. <br /> <br />Another thing I noticed--the editing of the book could have been better. There were many sentences that were sloppy; sentences which could have been tightened without losing Alda's voice. <br /> <br />**To Robin: How do you know that Alan Alda doesn't *have* to work due to royalties from M*A*S*H?  After a number of years of having a show in syndication, television actors receive pennies on the dollar in royalties. It is disingenious of you to say that Alda doesn't have to work. Alda himself has said (in interviews) he has to work. Whether for financial or creative reasons, that shouldn't be up for speculation.	2005-10-13

It isn't afraid to keep the action moving. Barely a page goes by without a change of pace or a new scene to take in. But a book needs to have its action bound together, and this is perhaps the book's [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest plus point. There is not one central theme, but several - all relevant to the The Prisoner, but previously largely unexplored within the series.  <br /> <br />The main themes - the cult of Celebrity, Mass-media, information technology, \\"Big Brother\\" Society, and terrorism, are all dealt with extremely well and whilst we might think of these as modern themes, and perhaps easy for the writers to explore, it's not so easy in practice to inject these into the Village setting, but somehow Blum and Booth manage to do just that. <br /> <br />When reading about a character called Number Six, one can't help but picture McGoohan uttering the lines, or performing the actions, and whilst this is the fault of this reviewer, the authors have to accept that in setting the book during the TV series, with McGoohan's Prisoner the lead character, most people reading the book will be doing the same. And this is perhaps the book's one failing, despite at times a damn good effort by the writers. <br /> <br />After a while I mentally changed from thinking of Number Six as McGoohan but as a \\"generic\\" Prisoner. This makes the book a more enjoyable read, in my opinion, but does this mean the authors have ultimately failed? Possibly, but not as far as I am concerned. \\"The Prisoner's Dilemma\\" isn't an additional episode fitting perfectly into \\"The Prisoner\\", but it doesn't have to be. It isn't an indispensible aspect of the \\"Prisoner\\" opus alongside such [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ks as \\"Free For All\\" or \\"Checkmate\\", but it was never meant to be. It isn't a perfect example of McGoohanesque dialogue. That would be impossible.  <br /> <br />What it is is a very good read. The themes explored are brave, without being reckless. The writing includeshumour, without lampooning the series. The approach is daring, without being arrogant. It references the series, without ripping it off. It's fast-paced, without getting sidetracked. And, perhaps most importantly, it dares to be different without being ridiculous. <br /> <br />Rick Davy (The Unmutual Website)	2005-10-13

But he seems wholly unaware of how his view totally shapes his reading and critic of the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K minds.<br /><br />For example, Plato suggests a society run by the elite who have been schooled in the correct management of a state. This, of course, is a very logical proposition. Durant finds many things to criticize with Plato's proposed society, but seems blissfully ignorant of that the power in Plato's society would reside within university walls since the one who shapes the training of our leaders holds as much power as the leaders themselves...but in fairness, I wouldn't expect someone who comes from the institution to critize a system that would give more power to people like himself.<br /><br />This may seem like a minor critic, and I guess it is, but Durant's book is full of such elitist and academic assumptions. So when combined with page after page of such assumptions and bias, it gets harder and harder to glean fact from his elitist opinions.<br /><br />After reading this book I get the sense that this author hasn't been shaped by the day-to-day performance of real work in the real world, but rather lives in his ivory tower where eloquent speech and high ideals take precedence over \\"mundane\\" things like the raising of a family and the struggle of the working class.<br /><br />Finally, Durant seems to revel in anti-Christian assumptions. He fails to give real criticism of some of the horrendous morals promoted by early philosophers (for example, a passing nod to the sanctity of life and the abhorrence of infanticide would have been nice). And his jumping from Aristotle to Francis Bacon seems to be his way of sticking his nose up to [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K Christian philosophers like Augustine, who, although a theologian, wrote [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K and influential treatises on subjects like time, truth, and free will.

While this was indeed the subject, the task of the course was more in line with what this text deals with - at the end of that course, we had to construct (as best we could) a consistent theology that dealt with the primary areas of theological concern.<br /><br />The editors Serene Jones and Paul Lakeland have divided this text into six major sections, dealing with the key areas of theological concern:  God; Human Being; Sin and Evil; Jesus Christ; Church; and Spirit.  The editors have made efforts to make a text useful to a diverse and somewhat paradoxical community situation - how does one honour the traditions while recognising innovation and individuality in the current theological scene?  How does one do theology for long-established communities, newly formed community, and those who seek a more personal theological development?<br /><br />In each section, the editors begin some quotes or stories, vignettes that show everyday applications of the issues - how people think about a particular idea, or what they do to bring their beliefs into practice.  They continue then with a 'State of the Question', which is a brief statement of introduction to the topic, highlighting salient points and areas of controversy.  Following this, the 'map' of the chapters proceed in two broad ways - a historical theological treatment and a contemporary theological treatment.  It is this latter part that is the longest section of each chapter, dealing with modern ideas from current theologians dealing with the issues in context of modern/post-modern culture, scientific knowledge, political realities, and more.  Throughout the text, there are bracketed sections (set off in different indentation and typeface) that are drawn from primary sources or set aside special questions that show a difference with the main progress of the chapter.<br /><br />This is very much a collaborative piece.  In addition to Jones and Lakeland as the overall editors, each primary chapter has its own editor, and each chapter is a synthesis of the writing and views of half a dozen or more theologians.  They are not presented in dialog form or in the form of separate essays, but rather in a more integrated way, which has both strengths and weaknesses.  This is true of the overall organisation of the book as well.  Jones and Lakeland address their reasoning for the way in which they have selected the categories: 'The answer is pragmatic.  Since our students know so little about the history of Christian theology and have limited training in the tradition, this pattern seemed best suited to teaching \\"the basics.\\" '  This is a book specifically designed to be used as and useful as a textbook for introductory theology.  In an era where an increasing number of seminary students are second- or third-career students who have had little or no history and philosophy training (much less theology training), this kind of approach is very welcome.<br /><br />The tradition behind this book includes the books 'Christian Theology' and 'Readings in Christian Theology', each by Peter Hodgson and others. (both of which I read in my seminary days) as well as 'Reconstructing Christian Theology' by Rebecca Chopp et al. (which I read on my own).  The first two books were done in the early 1980s, while Chopp's book was done in the 1990s, recognising shifts in the 'typical' students who enrolled in seminary.  Jones and Lakeland are again responding to a shift in the past ten years, one that has seen shifts not only in social location but educational purpose.<br /><br />One of the features of this text is the inclusion of a CD-ROM that has a lot of extra material, and links to a broader system through the Logos Library System.  At the time of this review, only PC format is supported, but an insert in the back of the book promises Macintosh capability soon.  (I PC at work, but Mac at home, and so look forward to the Mac application).  For those familiar with Windows environments, the software is easy to install and easy to navigate.

This is a story that is different in several ways from most of the Harlequins I have read.  Firstly Sara is several (it doesn't say exactly how many) years older than Matt, her eventual husband.  The book begins with her daughter driving off to her honeymoon.<br /><br />Sara has a few days to spare before she has to work again and winds up spending them with a total stranger that she instantly clicks with, Matt. And while I can't say it isn't sexual, at this point I am really impressed with the author's ability to attempt and build an authentic relationship between the two of them.  One that has to stand the trials of their imprompteu marriage that covers the other half of the book.<br /><br />Ultimately Sara is the better drawn of the two characters but Matt isn't entirely a cookie cutter, and the supporting characters are [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K, there is a real sense of community in this book.  I will have to hunt down the second book about Amber, Sara's daughter, and hopefully more about Matt and Sara is in that one.	2005-10-13

US	43519458	R3AWBYBJ0SRKRJ	0801027977	973781768	Is the Reformation Over?: An Evangelical Assessment of Contemporary Roman Catholicism	Books	2	47	91	N	N	What Is The Cost of Unity?	This is actually the second part of a review I posted at my own web site. I trust it will still convey my thoughts on the book.<br /><br />I would like to preface my analysis by expressing that the authors displayed a clear bias throughout the book. Mark Noll is an evangelical, and I believe Carolyn Nystrom is as well, and in this book they spend a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal of time expressing harsh criticism of evangelicalism. While I am Protestant and am perhaps being sensitive, it seems that they did not return the harsh rhetoric towards the Roman Catholic Church. We can see this bias displayed in the chapter discussing conversion from one tradition to another. In this section the authors provided several examples of evangelicals who converted to Catholicism, but no examples of conversion from Catholicism to Protestantism. This type of conversion is, in my experience, far more common and my church stands as an example. It is probably safe to say that our church is primarily composed of former Roman Catholics who left their church and then became believers. The bias is also clear in the chapter discussing ecumenical dialogues. The authors blame evangelicals for expressing anti-Catholic beliefs, but they provide no similar evidence for anti-Protestantism. They also provide no historical framework of persecution and Inquisition to show why Protestants expressed such distrust of the Catholic Church. Thus the reader needs to understand that this book expresses harsh attitudes towards Protestantism without corresponding harshness towards Roman Catholicism.<br /><br />Minimizing Theological Considerations<br /><br />Throughout the book the reader will note that the authors continually minimize theological considerations. Their overarching argument, as I expressed in the introduction to this review, is that the core disagreement between evangelicals and Roman Catholics is ecclesiology. This allows Noll and Nystrom to minimize theological disagreements as being of secondary importance. The authors' main strategy is not to thoroughly examine each point of doctrine where evangelicals disagree with Catholics (and sometimes vice versa), but to prove that issues over which Protestants often express concern are merely minor considerations in the larger area of the nature of the church. \\"In sum,\\" they say, \\"the central difference that continues to seperate evangelicals and Catholics is not Scripture, justification by faith, the pope, Mary, the sacraments or clerical celibacy - though the central difference is reflected in differences on these matters - but the nature of the church\\" (page 237). If the reader does not agree with that premise, he will likely not agree with most of the author's major conclusions.<br /><br />Issues Not Addressed<br /><br />It is clear that in a book of this size the authors cannot address every theological issue that seperates Protestant from Catholic. Yet there were at least two major disagreements that received no attention. The first of these is purgatory. The Catechism, which the authors often quote favorably, has this to say about purgatory: \\"All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven.\\" Needless to say, purgatory is a view that cannot be supported by a Protestant, biblical understanding of salvation. Purgatory calls into question the sufficiency of Jesus' suffering, for how effective was Christ's death if it needs to be supplemented by our own suffering? Did not Jesus die so that we did not need to suffer this type of torment?<br /><br />A second issue, and one that is perhaps even more important, has to do with the Eucharist. The authors deal in some depth with transubstatiation in which the bread and wine become the real presence of Christ. Yet this is not the most significant concern posed by the mass. Of far more importance is the understanding of the mass being a propitiation for sin. Protestants, having searched the Scriptures, believe that Christ's sacrifice was made once and had perfect, total efficacy. It does not need to be further supplemented or repeated in any way. Yet the Roman Catholic Church teaches that each celebration of the mass is a new, propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />These two issues are of critical importance, for they call into question the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice. Despite this, the authors overlook them altogether.<br /><br />The Fundamentals<br /><br />Phil Johnson recently posted an article written by John MacArthur entitled \\"Essential Christianity, not 'Mere Christianity'.\\" This article discussed the fundamentals of Christianity. MacArthur summarizes a Protestant understanding of the difficulties involved in attaining ecumenical unity. \\"Certainly any list of fundamentals would have to begin with these doctrines Scripture explicitly identifies as nonnegotiable: the absolute authority of Scripture over tradition (sola Scriptura), justification by faith alone (sola fide), the deity of Christ, and the Trinity.\\" While Roman Catholics and Protestants are able to agree on some of these issues, such as the deity of Christ and the Trinity, there are others where a vast chasm remains (justification by faith alone and the absolute authority of Scripture over tradition).<br /><br />There are several places in the book where the authors examine these issues in general, and justification in particular, and declare that there is no longer any critical difference between the Catholic and Protestant understandings of these pivotal issues. \\"If it is true, as once was repeated frequently by Protestants conscious of their anchorage in Martin Luther or John Calvin that iustificatio articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiae (justification is the article on which the church stands or falls), then the Reformation is over\\" (page 232). Time and space fail me to provide a detailed apologetic for the Protestant understanding of justification, but suffice it to say that the authors do nothing - absolutely nothing - to prove that an informed understanding of the biblical view of justification is now shared between Protestant and Catholic. In fact, the discerning reader will wonder whether the authors even truly understand the Protestant view of justification. Clever wording and ambiguous statements in ecumenical dialogue does not constitute change within the Catholic Church. Perhaps a repeal of the anathemas of the Council of Trent, anathemas which were affirmed at Vatican II, would prove that change had occured. But as it stands in official Roman Catholic statements of theology, the crucial differences remain.<br /><br />What of Scripture?<br /><br />Conspicuous by its absence is any real examination of Catholic or Protestant theology in light of the Scripture. There are very few quotes from the Bible and certainly very few attempts to examine either system of doctrine through the Bible. Page 248 finds the authors defending Catholicism by showing that the traditional complaints against Catholicism now exist in Protestantism. But what of Scripture, our guide? Writing, as they are, for a Protestant audience, it seems that proving all things from Scripture would advance their argument. Yet, it appears, they are unable to do so. We see this also in the discussion of justification. \\"The Roman Catholic Church now [post-Vatican II] articulates positions on salvation - even on justification by faith - that are closer to the main teachings of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation than are the beliefs of many Protestants, indeed, of many evangelical Protestants. Strange as it may seem to put it this way, the ECT documents present what can only be called a classically orthodox depiction of Christian salvation, primarily because they empahsize and build upon these official Catholic teachings\\" (page 180). But again, what of Scripture? Should we not allow Scripture to be our guide as we examine these issues?<br /><br />The Arguments<br /><br />The endorsements for this book would lead the reader to believe that it represents a high level of scholarship. J.I. Packer says, \\"Here is superb thelogical journalism.\\" David Wells writes that \\"This book offers a superbly researched, documented and engagingly argued case...\\" While the book does represent interesting research, I found the argumentation unconvincing. At the beginning of the fifth chapter the authors write, \\"Comments such as the following are heard frequently when evangelical Protestants talk about Catholicism\\" (page 115). They go on to list six comments, including \\"There is much I admire about the Catholic faith. But Catholics think Mary is a god, and the pope is their dictator - and then there is the whole question of celibacy;\\" \\"The people in my Baptist Sunday school class think that the Catholic Church is a cult. Should I argue about that?;\\" \\"Do Catholics believe they Bible? Are they allowed to read it?;\\" \\"I wish Catholics believed in grace. How can you be a Christian if you don't believe in salvation by grace through faith?\\" It seems to me that people who ask such basic, uneducated questions may be convinced by this book. Protestants who have created a mere caricature of Roman Catholic theology and practice may well be convinced. But those who have researched the issues and know the heart of the disagreement will remain unswayed.<br /><br />Is the Reformation Over?<br /><br />In the final analysis, the authors have failed to understand the core disagreement between Protestants and the Roman Catholic Church. There are clearly important disagreements about ecclesiology, and these are disagreements that are unlikely to be reconciled until Protestants are willing to accept the papacy. But there is a far deeper disagreement. At the heart of the Reformation was the gospel, which, incidentally, is a word and concept the authors use only rarely. The gospel message of justification by grace alone through faith alone, despite the authors' insistence to the contrary, is not present in official Roman Catholic doctrine.

The reader's mind is expanded beyond its pedestrian world to re-discover the grand cycles of the cosmos that was known to the ancient cultures.      \\"Lost Star\\" holds ones interest like a detective story as each new piece of evidence whets the reader's appetite for the next shard. The author engages the reader in solving no less than a cosmic mystery story.  The prize is nothing less the reconciliation of an ancient sacred science with today's understanding of a materialistic-based science.     The author cites a variety of excellent sources, a notable one,  \\"Hamlet's Mill\\" which was a seminal work by Giorgio de Santillana, professor of the history and philosophy of science at M.I.T. and Hertha von Dechend, professor of the history of science at the University of Frankfurt, which explored the encoding of precise astronomical knowledge into the worldwide myths and folklore. Typically, although this was written in the 1970's, mainstream academia has given little attention to this fact, as few people want to upset the status quo.      Mr. Cruttenden's breadth of intellectual curiosity culls from the ancient traditions of India to the most cutting edge think tanks of astrophysics.   His cross-disciplinary approach adds considerable fortitude to his thesis as he explores the phenomenon of \\"Precession\\" in the light of ancient mythology, archeology, and astrophysics.     The enigmas of archeology with its many \\"out-of-place\\" artifacts fall squarely into place should we tentatively accept the thesis of this book - the rise & fall of civilizations is a product of a grand cosmic cycle that was intimately known in the far distant past.   How could the ancients have known so much without the aid of our current technology? As the author suggests, perhaps there have been cultures so advanced as to use the rarified technologies of the mind and spirit in a time more conducive to the full development of those subtle qualities. Which brings to my mind, was this what Plato was referring to when discussing the possibility of attaining absolute knowledge via a \\"Science of First Causes?\\"  Contrast this a-priori (before-fact) or \\"consciousness-based\\" science with our current \\"trial and error,\\" a-posteriori (after-the-fact) science and I am reminded of Arthur C. Clarke's quote, \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\"      Prior to the rise of our western view of linear history the ancients' perspective of human history was a cyclical one.  Plato expounds this view in his famous dialogues in an attempt to recapture a long lost Golden Age.  The are many anomalies in the currently held view of linear history. These \\"exceptions\\" to the established paradigm continue to mount almost daily with new archeological discoveries worldwide, which the author aptly notes.  My own personal experience is that a cursory study of western art history reveals the flawed assumptions of a linear historical model.  Art students are immediately introduced to the mature art of the first dynastic periods of ancient Egypt only to see it's gradual decay over the next 3 millennia, not to mention the fact the we cannot duplicate the engineering feats of the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K pyramids that have blocks fitted to ultrasonic precision.    I urge anyone sincerely interested in the whence, whither and why of humanity's origins to read this book.	2005-10-13

About five years ago I picked up a copy of this book at the local library after I was referred to it by a librarian. It was one of those boring summers we kids suffer from, and I needed action. <br /> <br />This book delivered. Just when I guessed the plot, I was proven wrong. When I thought I knew how it was going to end, I was wrong. When I thought the character was in some deep trouble, I was wrong (of course, when I thought the character was in smooth-sailing, I was also wrong!) That is why I love this book so much... It challenged me to think of how it was going to change rather than the cliche endings and plots we have read thousands of times before. <br /> <br />Needless to say, I returned the book (it was very hard. I was ready to lie to the librarian to keep it!) As usual, life beckons and I never really sought to get a copy; this was, of course, prior to my Amazonian days. <br /> <br />For the last five years I have often thought about the book, and for the life of me, I could not remember what in the world the name of the book was... Wouldn't you guess that I would find it while looking up Monty Python movies? <br /> <br />In any event, if you like action-adventure-scifi-cool wormhole travel beams that magically appear in the desert-and more, then you will totally dig this book. In fact, if you like any fictional texts at all, you will like this book. Get it, read it, analyze it, enjoy it.

In any case...<br /><br />This is far from my favorite C J Cherry book...<br /><br />Which is to say it is a very good book, just not one of the top twenty books I've ever read.<br /><br /> Ms. Cherryh is in my opinion the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest writer living or dead when it comes to culture, and world creating. In this story there are three which are dealt with. Primarily, there is the culture of a quarantined space station, what would make life worth living for young adults in a place where there is no real struggle or getting out. The moral of the story seems to be the role of art, (strangely in this story the art of personal appearance), in society. There is a typical Cherryh disdain for how politics always get in the way of good and talented people doing the right thing.<br /><br />Secondarily, the culture of the planet below is dealt with, including the immortality of the protagonist of the previous story.<br /><br />And finally, the outside universe is dealt with as the paranoid who are afraid of what they don't understand.<br /><br />So if you don't want a story where you have to think, then this is not a story for you. Of course if you don't want to think,  C J Cherryh is probably not the author for you. Try Koonts. Or maybe Matthew Reilly, (both are authors whom I enjoy) depending on how you don't want to think. However if you want to explore the \\"what if\\" side of human interaction, and the shades of gray in character, this is one you might enjoy. I did.	2005-10-13

The majority of the text is written in the form of quick diary notes commenting on some particular topic of the day.  Next day's notes might concern a completely unrelated issue.  Then there could be an inexplicable gap of a few days with no entries in the diary at all.  There is no sense of continuity of events.  The book does not present even one map - how one can discuss military operations without maps is a mystery to me.  On top of all that, the editor has done a terrible job too.  The introductory essay as well as the subsequent chapters is riddled with grammatical mistakes, making the book even more unbearable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of the above becomes immediately apparent upon quick look at the book, which is beautifully bound, has [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K paper and exquisite selection of fonts.<br /><br />Mind you, I am not suggesting that Fedor von Bock himself is not a fascinating commander - he may very well be, but there is no way of telling from this book.	2005-10-13

I have also lived most of my life in Utah, specifically the Salt Lake area.  I originally picked up the book because I wanted some [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K ghost stories and really came back with what I already felt or believed about their presence.  I think Linda didn't focus on the evil or gore because there is already too much of it in the world.  I also believe that as Linda is one who is very sensitive to matters of the spirit and past experience we may not understand how overwhelming it may really feel to experience tragic or evil situations.  I picked up rather quickly that when it was an overtly intense, sad, or evil feeling experience she left... she chose not to go there.  So yes, if you are looking for that kind of experience, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />  However, if you want to read a book that may cause you to look at the little grove of trees by the Cotton Bottom and hear an old man wistling a tune as he works happily in his yard or look at the Hotel Utah and think of a time when it wasn't quite so reverent this is a place to \\"live in\\" for a moment.  I will never look at Jordon Commons the same without thinking of a bus full of children headed for school on a wintry morning colliding with a tragic fate.  My grandmother went to Jordan high at that time, she was fifteen...what did she loose in that accident?  Her innocence?  Her best friend?  I will never look at an old building the same.  Now they are living, breathing entities with stories to be told.  I drive around now and picture my ancestors working in the mills that filled the valley.  Some may still walk amongst us and we may catch a wisp of movement or the sense of their strength and perseverence.  It's the feeling of continuity that this book gave to me, the feeling that we are not so far seperated from those who came before us and loved their land.  It was a time before every house is at risk of being torn down so that two or three more can replace it as the land is swollowed up...a land that holds the memories of their hard working hands building a future they believed would be filled with their children's children's children.  I love Utah more now than I ever have before.<br /><br />  I liked the comments and involvement of mormon culture and I am a strong mormon.  I can see where Linda got her roots and they have influenced so much of the way she sees life.  I was interested to hear some of the ways we mormons approached life when we first arrived here.  Knowing better helps me to understand some of my neighbors better and why there are sometimes harsh feelings under the surface that date from a long time ago.  I like being informed.<br /><br />  I don't want to write my own book here but this book was a little bit of magic for me.  It seemed that everytime I read about a certain place I would run into someone tied to it somehow and we would talk about what I had read.  I would read at night and the next day I would drive past the place on my daily errands.  Linda, I hope you read this some day and know how much I have enjoyed it.  Thank you for all the time you did take.  Thank you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Rebecca<br /><br />Salt Lake City	2005-10-13

She spent summers with her grandmother in Kingston, in a house overflowing with assorted, very colorful relatives. Early on Carole realized that she wanted to experience the world beyond the small towns she knew. Watching the space shuttle Challenger explode on national television was a turning point in Carole's life. She immediately realized what it was that she wanted to do --- she wanted to tell the story, not watch it unfold on television. <br /> <br />Armed with natural curiosity and a strong work ethic, Carole, a 19-year-old student at Hunter College, began her journalism career as a humble, unpaid intern for ABC. She was a quick study and soon became a production secretary for \\"Closeup.\\" Before long she was traveling to Cambodia for \\"Peter Jennings Reporting.\\" Carole was very well-suited for the career she chose. <br /> <br />It was at ABC where she met her Polish prince, Anthony Stanislas Albert Radziwill, nephew of Jackie Kennedy. A slow-starting attraction, often interrupted by their careers, turned into something serious, and culminated in Anthony and Carole's wedding in 1994. This would not be a typical marriage with children and happily ever after, although the newlyweds did not realize it at the time. It would be a threesome: Anthony, Carole, and Anthony's cancer. <br /> <br />Anthony and his famous cousin, John F. Kennedy, Jr., were like brothers growing up. As adults they still played clever practical jokes on each other, a game they referred to as \\"I got you.\\" Carole and John's wife, Carolyn, became confidants and best friends. The two young couples had a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal in common and were together whenever their busy schedules permitted. <br /> <br />The book details Anthony's struggles with his illness and Carole's role in managing it, as if cancer could be managed. Anthony was the stoic patient, Carole the patient's advocate. They had an unspoken pact --- that Anthony would somehow overcome his disease. They never admitted to each other that he would not. Carolyn was devoted to Carole and spent hours at her side, buoying Carole's spirits and encouraging her to take care of herself, too. <br /> <br />Three weeks before Anthony succumbed to cancer, John's small plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing John, Carolyn, and Carolyn's sister. It was perhaps fate that Carole was the one to report the plane missing. <br /> <br />There are three important relationships in WHAT REMAINS: the brother-like bond between the two cousins, the close friendship of their wives, and Anthony and Carole's marriage. <br /> <br />On the book jacket four Adirondack chairs sit on a deck on a sandy beach. Three chairs face the ocean. A solitary chair faces land. What remains for Carole are the memories of fate, friendship and love, for it is her chair that faces land (life). Anthony, John and Carolyn's chairs all face the ocean. <br /> <br />WHAT REMAINS is a testimony to the human spirit. It is beautifully and honestly written. The reader feels he or she has peeked into the author's soul and glimpsed courage, wisdom and love. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carole Turner	2005-10-13

As potential evidence for this, Ronner shows the amazing similarities between Abraham Lincoln, JFK & Ceasar; and then also between Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.<br /><br />Then Ronner discusses the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K number of \\"end of days\\" prophecies - why there are so many, and potential reasons for why they've all been wrong to date.  Could it be that we're constantly changing our future, and that previous prophecies were merely one of the many potential outcomes for our planet?<br /><br />The scientific evidence for prophetic abilities, as well as information on various \\"prophets/seers\\" is then provided, along with various types of divination techniques.  The question of whether or not everyone has these abilities is then touched on.<br /><br />Last, Ronner shows the amazing power of the mind in creating our experiences/future.  This makes sense given the well-known evidence re: the \\"self fulfilling prophecy\\" - we get what we believe we will get...<br /><br />Overall, I found \\"Seeing Your Future\\" to be an interesting, easy read.  As such, I would highly recommend it to those interested in the \\"paranormal\\" in general, and prophecy/prediction in particular.	2005-10-13

Brian Floca figured out something for \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" that a lot of author/illustrators could benefit from remembering.  If you're writing a book, be it alphabet, fairy tale, or plain old run-of-the-mill fiction, and your story is about a non-fiction subject, do adults like me a favor and include some factual information at the beginning for them to bone up on.  That way, when they read this book to their hepped up five-year-olds, they'll avoid the embarrassment of a blank stare that comes when a preschooler asks, \\"Why are the racecars driving through a city and not a racetrack?\\".  It's funny, but the only real problem I've had with this book is that it IS an alphabet book.  If it were not, it would probably have a much wider audience.  Sometimes the choices an author makes are more confining than they can anticipate.  Doesn't make the book bad, though.<br /><br />The book's endpapers consist of eighteen racecars dating between a 1901 Ford 999 to a souped up 2001 Ferrari F1-2001.  On the front endpapers, the cars face towards the reader.  On the back endpapers they face away.  The fact that Floca took the time to make a change that most people won't even notice is a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K way of understanding this book.  Floca is, if nothing else, meticulous.  After a quick note on, \\"One Hundred Years of Racecars\\" we reach the title page and an image of a man driving a very clunky, mighty dirty car down a dirt road.  The first double page spread reads, \\"Automobiles - machines on wheels\\".  And we're off!  Each letter begins a sentence that describes the racecar attitude right from the start.  Sometimes these sentences are alliterative jolts of energy like, \\"Flat feared and fought, the driver's foe\\".  Sometimes (as in the case of an injured driver) they're a single word.  \\"Yelp!\\".  By the end of the book we have witnessed a variety of different cars over the years and an increasingly complex sport.<br /><br />My husband just looked over my shoulder as I was writing this review and felt it necessary to point out that it is really difficult to draw cars.  Now imagine drawing a shockingly wide variety of them.  You have to be able to distinguish a car that was clearly popular in 1976 to its hoity-toity 1992 equivalent.  So well done there, Mr. Floca.  My husband also points out that the book completely skips over the period of history where moonshiners started racing their cars in the Southern hills.  No such tribute to these racing pioneers appears in this book.  You may be relieved or outraged as you see fit.<br /><br />In my experience, \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" is hampered only by the word \\"Alphabet\\" in its title.  Intelligent preschoolers who're into automobiles will pass on this book because they think the alphabet is too babyish for them.  I often want to explain to them that the alphabet aspect of this publication is hardly the focus.  You wouldn't even necessarily know it was there unless someone pointed it out to you!  My pleas fall on deaf ears, though, and I wish that Floca had been a little less original in his formatting.  An odd wish.<br /><br />Brian Floca is, at this point in history, probably best known for the illustrations he's done for Avi's mighty popular (and well-written) \\"Poppy\\" series.

If you are really serious about becoming a servlet/JSP developer, I recommend checking out another O'Reilly book: \\"JavaServer Pages\\" by Hans Bergsten. Why? Because while Heard First's strength is trees, JavaServer Page's strength is the forest itself.

I believe Bakari Kitwana puts a completely new spin on this question due to his clear enjoyment and understanding of hip-hop.  He is able to look at hip-hop with less prejudice than many authors who have attempted to tackle this question.  Kitwana uses convincing reasoning, such as whites' decreasing sense of racial privilege, and strong opinions to advance his arguments on why white kids love hip-hop. <br />     I recommend this eloquent book to any hip-hop enthusiasts especially those interested in the question \\"why do white kids love hip-hop?\\"  Not to say that this book is by any means perfect, Kitwana has his own unique set of prejudices like anyone and he has a tendency to belittle the work of some less hardcore hip-hop fans.  Overall it is a wonderful book, a true must-read in my opinion.  This is an adult book but it is not terribly long or difficult to read and while it does feature some necessary racial epithets it doesn't uselessly throw around foul language.  A [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book for the avid hip-hop listener or anyone who has ever wondered just why white kids love hip-hop.	2005-10-13

When you decide to incorporate a style of meditation into your life then a whole-body Vipassana might bring you more peace of mind. It is a sensation-based style of meditation.<br /><br />Marshall Glickman has a beautiful writing style and his ideas connect perfectly with the modern reader who may or may not be familiar with meditation. His ideas are presented in a way that makes meditation come alive. I used to think meditation was complete stillness and lack of thought, but there are ways to focus on sensation that bring you to a deeper understanding of yourself. Some of the intellectually intriguing aspects of this work include:<br /><br />The Power and Pleasure Principle<br />The Biochemical Basics of Pleasure<br />The Neurochemistry of Karma<br /><br />There are chapters filled with instructions on how to meditate, but the real highlights of this book are the insights into living life effectively and understanding how our bodies function on the chemical level.<br /><br />\\"Focusing on sensations puts us more directly in touch with what's motivating us, while at the same time helping to free us from the storylines which tend to obscure our feelings. In this way, [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Ker awareness to our sensations increases our emotional sensitivity.\\" ~Marshall Glickman<br /><br />If you have trouble settling into a meditation session, do yoga first. It helps your body to work out all the extra energy that might keep you from sitting still. You can also meditate while reclining in bed or while sitting in a chair. You don't have to meditate in a guru-style seated position. I normally meditate while laying flat on my back after an invigorating yoga practice. Some of the most blissful happy places I've ever been have been after doing a Chakra Yoga workout. I finally understood the place meditation could take you. I like imagining colors inside my body and working with sensations and the release of negative thoughts. I've noticed that when I do meditate I think more clearly and can solve problems more effectively. When I don't meditate, chaos creeps into my life.<br /><br />After reading this work, you may also enjoy Tobin Blake's \\"The Power of Stillness: Learn Meditation in 30 Days.\\"<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review've ever been have been after doing a Chakra Yoga workout.

Fisher and Shapiro highlight five ways that you can improve the tone of just about any interaction (e.g., through respecting autonomy, affiliation, status, etc.).  The result is that you can get what you want.  I truly believe that anybody who negotiates - whether with family, a colleague at work, or a tough counterpart - can benefit from this book.  It's written in the same tone as \\"Getting to Yes\\" - i.e., you can read it in a few hours.  And just like Getting to Yes, there are a few big points that are completely practical.

Kahn's stellar research for this volume on Coltrane's best known album, \\"A Love Supreme,\\" is undermined by sloppy prose and lack of focus.  Kahn does a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K job showing just how powerful the album has been for generations of listeners, from Wayne Shorter to Bono.  The biographical material on Coltrane is very good, but profoundly impersonal, skipping over key aspects of his life.  The best part of the book is his meticulous documentation of the December 9 & 10, 1964 sessions that resulted in this album.  Kahn describes the music with vivid language, and includes details about where Elvin Jones' drums were placed and how Rudy Van Gelder lit the studio to create a Jazz Club atmosphere for the performers.  After that, Kahn's book loses focus.  It's as if he had a 100 page manuscript, but then the folks at Penguin asked him to make it 250, and he had scratch around for any extra material he could find.  His assessment of Coltrane's career post-\\"A Love Supreme\\" is very tepid, and the chapter on the legacy of the recording, especially from the vantagepoint of JOWCOL publishing, shows promise, but ultimately goes nowhere.  Kahn's major problem here is that he doesn't know who his audience is.  Is it for die-hard Trane-iacs, or is it for the casual listener that has \\"A Love Supreme\\" and no other Coltrane album?  Some of this might not be Kahn's fault, as the content suggests this is for experts, but the formating of the book, with its wide margins and coffee-table book size, make it seem as if it's simply for show and tell in some bourgeois apartment.  The book could have been better organized, more historically contextual, and filled with glossaries and footnotes for the more casual fans.  Also, Kahn's lack of historical grounding makes it seem as though \\"A Love Supreme\\" was the only album released in 1965, and that jazz was the most popular music at that time, which is far from the case (just as it is today).  Here, his homage to this wonderful album bleeds over into therealm of adulation.  If this was a book for the \\"experts,\\" it would be more critical of the album, instead of an all-out gush-fest.  But Kahn's research must be commended (especially since he seems to be responsible for getting the December 10th performance of \\"Acknowledgment,\\" with Davis and Shepp as added musicians, unearthed and onto the Deluxe Edition reissue of \\"A Love Supreme).	2005-10-13

Its eccentric characters could fit right into our own family scrapbooks, and its reverence for the past and suspicion of the encroaching future pose a conflict being played out across the length and breadth of Dixie-and might even be encapsulated in our ambivalence nowadays toward using the word \\"Dixie\\" as a synonym for the South.  <br /> Just outside of Palmetto, S.C., in the small town of Sans Souci, Cutter Johanson lives in a dilapidated mansion that houses the comforting ghosts of her ancestry. The urban sprawl of Palmetto, which is a thinly disguised Greenville, threatens to engulf the small town that has been home to Cutter's family for generations, but an even more immediate threat is that the death of Cutter's grandmother has brought the house up for sale. Desperate to keep the old home place, Cutter goes to [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K lengths to sabotage efforts to sell it, but she knows she is fighting a losing battle. Her sister Ginny, \\"the pretty one,\\" and brother Barry, away in service, are eager to sell, and Cutter, though working two jobs, both menial, can not afford to buy them out.  <br /> Enter a kind of Delphic fate: Ginny, a college student, is having an affair with a teacher, Daniel Byers, and is pregnant by him. His aggrieved wife Elizabeth is an emotional cripple whose agoraphobia and panic attacks keep her a virtual prisoner in her home, significantly a run-of-the-mill subdivision ranch house. Not least, Elizabeth's main affliction is a husband so caring that he seems to have an unhealthy need for his wife to remain a cripple. Stir into that mix an anonymous telephone tip to the unsuspecting wife, and a solution to Cutter's problem that she could never have imagined is set in motion. <br /> The attentive reader will see it coming when Elizabeth somehow manages to summon the strength to venture out and knock on the Johansons' front door. When Cutter answers the door, the die is cast: Two oddballs, one strong, one weak, come face to face, and the reader, recognizing their compatibility right away even if they don't, knows that they will wind up with each other when the dust has cleared-though in what arrangement is a nice, and logical, surprise.  <br /> The story of how all this happens is highly readable and, for the most part, deliciously written. Ms. Friddle's prose shines, especially with apt and poetic similes--but she comes awfully close to overdoing a good thing: Too many similes can be tiring and come across finally as the same artistic trick done too often to retain its freshness or, worse, as a kind of misdirection. Not for nothing did Gertrude Stein advise writers that in describing something it is usually better to say what a thing is than what it is like, i.e. \\"A rose is a rose is a rose.\\"	2005-10-13

Everest of biographies with this five-parter about the complex, self-contradictory, vain, politically problematic and always fascinating Hemingway. The book concentrates on that period between the publication of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and the completion of his first draft of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" three years later. It takes us from Hemingway's drafty art studio in Paris where he lived during and after his divorce from Hadley and the embarking on his marriage with Pauline Pfeiffer. <br /> <br />The pressure's on when, after the publication of \\"Men Without Women\\" in 1927, Hemingway needs to follow up \\"Sun...\\" with another equally brilliant novel. He frets with an idea about a son's journey from America to Europe with his father, a spy-for-hire. But then drops the idea. He marries Pauline, travels around France and Spain, writes a couple of more [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K short stories before launching into his tale of a wounded American soldier's love affair with an English nurse during WWI. Hemingway went from Paris to Key West to Pigotte, AK (where Pauline went home to deliver their new baby) to Montana, back to Oak Park to deal with a terrible family tragedy and back to Europe, all as he composed \\"Farewell.\\" What's so wonderful about Reynolds telling it is how emotionally caught up in these events you get--after all, Hem's wife delivered him a new son AND his Oak Park family collapsed and needed Hem to build it back up, both WHILE WRITING THIS BOOK--a heroic feat on Hem's part of artistic discipline. There are sections of Reynolds' book that left me in tears, especially his gorgeous closing sections where you really feel Hemingway has arrived at the threshold of myth--he's left his Oak Park boyhood and his young apprenticeship in Paris with Stein, Pound, etc. behind and come into his own--as a writer, a personality and a genius. <br /> <br />A beautiful, evocative, heartfelt tour de force.	2005-10-13

Works better as a gosippy tell-all on the early lives of the players his brutal boot camp helped make famous than it does as anything else. At times Bolletteri's ego speaks a little too loudly and the pace of the book bogs down because of things like the printing of letters he wrote to his one-time students. The man many consider the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kest tennis coach of all time admits here that those who charged he pushed teenagers too far too fast in pursuit of champions, were probably right. He tells some funny stories, like one about Andre Agassi having a collection of empty whiskey bottles in his room, even though no one ever saw the teen drinking and he was monitered almost around the clock as part of the regimented curriculum: a mystery to this day. I used to imagine what it would be like at this famous camp but after reading this book I was so turned off by the military school-like atmosphere described that I'm glad imagining is all I ever did. I guess the jury will always be out on Nick Bollettieri's role in the rise to fame of so many of those who spent time at his Florida center. Some like Mary Pierce credit Bollettieri with making them their best; others downplay their former coach's contribution. This is Nick Bollettieri's chance to put in his two-cents worth, and he does...or maybe it's more like a dollar's worth.	2005-10-13

But they are incredible mind-candy and difficult to put down.  There's also a heck of a lot of them, and given that they weren't written in a chronology synchronous with the chronology of Sharpe's exploits, it takes a little running around to read them in order.<br /><br />Having begun with Sharpe's Tiger, it seems to me to be the best place to start - introducing the reader to Sharpe himself, the execrable Obadiah Hakeswill, Mr. Lawford, and Wellington.  It is interesting to see how Cornwell starts to lose track of certain details as the novels skip around in time, but he's written so much that it is certainly hard to keep track of everything.<br /><br />I have a sneaking suspicion that Bernard Cornwell is another nom-de-plume for Stephen King, given the prolixity of his work and the none-too-subtle repetitive patterns of each book. I won't know for sure until Richard Sharpe comes out in favor of abortion and against nuclear energy.  If the authors are one and the same, then Mr. King has found another way to extract my hard earned money.<br /><br />Anyway - [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K entertainment!

I found that place of manifesting, when reading this book-- just for a few days, but it was incredible.  I just looked out and into myself for the power, not UP, and spoke the the words of what I wished. It was there! Boom. Happened.  The ideas and methods in this book work. It is my $6800 book.  <br />  <br />The method I used is not available to everyone. And some might dismiss it as a fluke or luck. I know it was neither. It was too extraordinary.  No accident, because I literally thought of the book, Wake Up, It's Time To Remember, then called it forth.   <br />  <br />I'd leased my business. It was a leaky row boat, but got me out of there at a crucial time, when I was very depressed. The guy really burned me, and when I had to come back I was devastated and so in debt. It was a struggle. I had insurances coming due that had to be paid and several other huge outlays of money payable. The list was long and seemed no way I would get through it.  <br /> <br />We have gaming machines in Nevada and I was reading Wake Up, It's Time to Remember. Gambling is not something I would recommend, because it is a serious trap, but I just looked at that machine and knew that I would have the money, so it wasn't even really gambling. I went into a zone of absolute knowing and just called forth the results. I hit four other machines in a row for a total of $6800. <br /> <br />Do I recommend the book? You \\"bet\\" I do! This book is about winning in life, not just about money.  Abundance comes from hedging the bet. The author understands these principles so well, there is no need of beating around the bush. This book demonstrates how to do that in a dramatic narrative that is easy to apply.  <br />Acara Kaes <br />	2005-10-13

I expected to read about the lives of the women who were in the \\"hand-picked\\" bookclub in Iran, and how they may have used literature to overcame the struggles faced by women in the middle-east.    Instead, the book is more a memoir of the author's life. The many friends, co-wokers, family and women she writes about remind me of someone discussing their trophies.  She proves over and over again that her NEED to teach is more to force her own narcassic viewpoints rather than encouraging students to draw their own conclusions.  How sad for those studying under her.        Although the book touches on the lives of the members of the group, the author spends much of her time sharing personal stories of what it was like for her during her years as a rebellious, demonstrating young college woman NOT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT IN THE UNITED STATES while attending college. Instead of blending the use of various [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K literature pieces into the story to show how the women used such works as \\"Lolita\\" to help them cope with their lives, she ran on and on and on with excerpts from various works, and did not relate them to current problems in the Middle East.       I felt at times the author was using this book as a means for her to come to terms with herself and how her own life had changed rather than enlighten the public of the struggles in the Middle East.        If someone has little knowledge of the struggles of women who are opressed in the Middle East,then you may enjoy this book.  If you, however have a general knowledge from other books, then I am almost certain you will find this book long, drawn out and boring.	2005-10-13

This book is an answer to a question many people have been avoiding all their lives.  And when you finally develop the ability to ask it to yourself, Sartre provides his suggested answer for you, though it may not be the answer you wanted.<br /><br />The premise of the main play, \\"No Exit\\", is that many people have chosen to exist in misery, even when the exit to that misery presents itself clearly.  For these people, there is \\"no exit\\".  Their existance is defined by their misery.  If they make the concious decision to exit, then they have nothing to live for.<br /><br />All four plays are written in non-pretentious and easy to understand styles, unlike many philisophical writings.  They don't require a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal of effort to read or understand.  In fact, they are quite enjoyable and I found myself reading each play many times before moving on to the next one.<br /><br />Don't expect to feel uplifted about the state of humanity while reading these plays, however.  Sartre's message about human existance can be a dismal one.  It is quite helpful, though, to come to terms with the fact that many of our fellow humans are just puzzled about their lives, and sharing a social existance with these people can be precarious to your own search for meaning.	2005-10-13

I first came upon employer/employee conflict resolution here in the US as a recently appointed  manager in New Jersey. An employee had voluntarily left in the face of discovery of some major rule violation and was disputing the denial of employment benefit. We both showed up at a dingy little office in Dover NJ and waited until the adjudicating officer was ready. This was a rather intimidating woman who exuded authority and made it clear that she was in charge and we must follow procedures. Each side presented their case, could question the other side's account and she would determine the outcome to be notified in the mail within a period of time. No lawyers, no bureaucratic paperwork, relatively quick decision. The facts were on my side with my concise and appropriate documentation. The pther party was denied.<br /><br />Contrast the situation in Britain, a rather lighter regulated workforce than the European but heavily regulated in comparison to America. Since the time of writing the book, lanour market regulation has increased although the European Commission President has stated that he wishes to reduce the volume of regulations generated by the European Union.<br /><br />Shackleton traces the creation, youth and developing adult story of employment tribunals a quasi-legal system established to deal with the disputes between employer and employee without trampling the well worn path to litigation so prevalent here in the United States. He clearly articulates a reform path by judiciously examining the pros and cons of the system as one would expect a prominent labour economist of his calibre to do. He looks at some alternatives and the Blair government's attempts to reform the system, simplify it and make it cheaper. He outlines a case for reform and rejects radical reform as being more difficult than the Thatcher union reforms of the 1980's.<br /><br />Shackleton makes the salient point that tribunals tend to be more concerned about employess and their grievances rather than the bigger picture of affecting the costs of labour to employers in the market place. It is a crucial point which is often overlooked. Whereas other costs are also added by the impact of bodies such as the Commission for Racial Equality, this impact is usually overlooked by the broader population.<br /><br />The regulation of the labour market is not, per se, something that any person would fundamentally object to. In the eyes of the dominant ideology people find fulfillment in their work. Yet one would think that these two things would be understood together and not as individual concerns. The plain fact is that too much regulation raises the costs of employers and reduces their competitiveness, leading to the loss of business and the accompanying jobs. Of course employers can respond with more labour saving capital investment which reduces the market for less skilled workers and increases marginally the demand for high skilled workers. In today's world, the post-industrialised west faces growing competition from Eastern European, Indian and Chinese economies who have the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K advantage of comparatively lower paid, but relatively highly educated workforces to rely on.<br /><br />Shackleton's point is one that is being ignored at our peril, to a lesser extent in the UK than in other countries such as France. In the global economy, the competitive advantage is eroded by the businesses with the best response. Protection is increasingly less of an option than it appears. Impenetrable walls can disappear quicker than they were constructed.<br /><br />For whatever reason Shackleton argues that the case for radical reform would face tough resistance, society should look at what is politically impossible. The case for real radical reform and widespread labour market deregulation is unassailable. The consequences of continued protectionism will be wholescale loss of markets and jobs that cannot be easily won back.<br /><br />We all want better workplace. Weall want more holidays, more pay, better treatment or subsidised mortgages but we can only have those things if the businesses we work for can compete effectively in the global marketplace and consistently be successful. Even the mighty General Motors cannot live on past glories alone. All politicians should consider the arguments that Shackleton has marshalled here and act accordingly.

In The Disciplined Mind, he takes those concepts and combines them to define a minimum educational standard:  Introducing students to the thought processes of major disciplines to appreciate important issues from the perspective of multiple intelligences.<br /><br />To exemplify the point, Professor Gardner develops examples of his concept involving Darwin's Finches (as a window on evolutionary thinking), one scene from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart (as a window onto social commentary and music) and the Wannsee Conference in Nazi Germany (as a window onto the banal evil of the Holocaust).  He sees the fundamental questions that education should address as following into the subjects of truth, beauty and goodness (or good versus evil) which these three examples epitomize.<br /><br />Those sections were [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K fun, but the most valuable part of the book comes in chapter 10 where he addresses \\"Getting There\\".  It's a marvelous description of how to create positive organizational change within education.  Professor Gardner gets tough in pointing out that good leadership is essential.  Otherwise, multidisciplinary means just messing around with whatever appeals to you . . . and not learning a darn thing of lasting importance.<br /><br />I can relate to that point.  One of my first college courses was intended to teach us the historical discipline by working with primary sources about the Entresol Club in France before the Revolution.  But the case didn't really work for that purpose and the leadership was muddled.  The only thing I learned was the entresol was the floor above the ground floor in a French building.  That has helped me in elevators several times since then.  But I had to learn the historical discipline elsewhere.<br /><br />He points out several key lessons:<br /><br />Have a long-term perspective<br /><br />Be flexible and seek small victories<br /><br />Anticipate setbacks and be prepared for them<br /><br />Allow time for reflection<br /><br />Build on strengths<br /><br />Pay attention to implicit messages in the institutional culture<br /><br />Create a community that cares<br /><br />Visit and be visited<br /><br />Cultivate new energies<br /><br />Commit yourself to the process of change<br /><br />I was reminded of Peter Senge's excellent book, The Dance of Change, as I read this section.<br /><br />The next best part of the book came in chapter 9 where Professor Gardner explained how multiple intelligences can be brought to bear for understanding.<br /><br />This material is a classic for introducing any important subject:<br /><br />1.

This book clearly points a way to gain that edge by differentiating my offerings from a large majority of my competitors. I've often thought that most photographs used in e-bay marketing are mediocre, at best, my own included. When I see a good e-bay photographic presentation, I recognize the selling power that it represents, but I have rarely accomplished it myself. Sinclair and Livingston have produced a terrific book. If you read it and apply the material, almost anyone (including me) can produce \\"above average\\" photographs for their e-bay marketing. The book is a quick-read, but provides an excellent reference souce for later application of the material it contains. I've read a couple other e-bay books by Joe Sinclair and one thing I like about all these books is that they have a nice clean easy-to-read layout. Each chapter in this book has substantial stand-alone value. A chapter that may be a trinket to you might be a treasure to me, and vice versa. In total, however, the book will have [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K value to any serious e-bay marketer. If \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\", then several very good pictures make a powerful e-bay sales presentaion, indeed.

Edwards investigates Reagan's childhood, his leadership qualities and his accomplishments with keen insight and understanding.<br /><br />The narrative concentrates on those people, events and circumstances that shaped the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K man's character and career path, from his childhood and student days through his movie career, his two stints as governor of California and his presidency.<br /><br />Both the failures and the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K and enduring successes of the Reagan administration are covered. For example, Edwards looks at the Iran-Contra debacle as well as the economic miracle, the benefits of deregulation and the West's victory in the Cold War.<br /><br />A highlight of the book is Edwards' analyses of the four essential qualities of leadership that Reagan possessed: courage, justice, prudence and wisdom. The author points out how these qualities came into play at various occasions in Reagan's life and career.<br /><br />He discusses the books that helped persuade Reagan to change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican and in the bibliographical essay at the end, he reviews the best and the worst books on the 40th President. The Essential Ronald Reagan concludes with copious notes and a thorough index.<br /><br />I also recommend the books [[ASIN:0142001686 When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan]] by Peggy Noonan, [[ASIN:0684848236 Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader]] by Dinesh D'Souza and [[ASIN:0789479923 Ronald Reagan: An American Hero]], with an introduction by William F Buckley.

Of the generation of [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K American writers who reshaped our language, he was a lively fully engaged fellow and not prisoner of any ivory tower, despite his peerless credentials.  Line by line, stanza by stanza, it shows.  The Comedy requires many talents and understanding life and people is not the least of them.<br /><br />\\"Dante was a drummer,\\" Ciardi aptly notes in his introduction, and Ciardi's meter and rhyme scheme give a good English facsimile of Dante's incessant, intoxicating drum beat -- his famous 11 beat terza rima.  You simply cannot do it in English, where most words end in hard consonants, not open vowels as in Italian.  Yeah some people have tried -- always a noble aim -- but unless you're Superman don't climb Everest without oxygen.  Purism will never get most of us through a first reading of this poem or for that matter through a few readings after.  Music is what you need and Ciardi expertly lays it down.<br /><br />About the poem?  I've read it 7 times through, in different translations (Ciardi thrice) over 40 years and am just getting started.  I do Ciardi between the others because I love my good modern Yankee language, soon drown without it.  Ciardi really understands it -- from the jive of the street punk to the most austere scholar or saint -- its all here -- Dante's whole world talking to you like everybody you ever met.	2005-10-13

After some thought, Mr. Farrant decided that he would take on the task and he began to collect the ghost stories that would eventually form this book.<br /><br />Mr. Farrant has a superb writing style and he relates his stories with a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K deal of enthusiasm. It is also obvious that he enjoys his subject and even more importantly that he respects his subject. There is nothing worse that a writer of ghost books who looks down on his subject matter or on those who read their books.  He also does a good job of relating the atmosphere of the Georgia coast, which is quite a feat for a transplanted Yankee like Mr. Farrant.<br /><br />There are several excellent stories to be found in this book. Stories that contain recent eyewitness accounts of haunts that are still in progress make up the majority of the chapters and those are the kinds of stories that make or break a book like this one. Even some of the stories about ghosts that seem to have gone away are of a recent enough nature that the author was able to interview people who had experienced the haunt while it was still active. Accounts like this need to be preserved and the Mr. Farrant has done an excellent job of doing just that.<br /><br />There are unfortunately, a few stories in this book that fall into the category of old legend and folklore and this book would have been much better if the author had decided to leave these stories out. For example, the stories of \\"The Legend of Ebo Landing\\" and \\"An Old St. Simons Ghost Story\\" were interesting but really had no place in this book. Fortunately though, these kinds of stories were few and far between. There are also a few typos in this book, which I hope will be corrected in future editions, and I hope that there are many printings of this excellent book.<br /><br />Don Farrant has put together a fine collection of haunting tales from an area that is woefully underrepresented in this genre of book and he is to be thanked for his efforts. There are a few weak points but not many and the author's ability as a storyteller is on a par with the best in the business. I am eagerly looking forward to future works from Mr. Farrant.on Farrant has put together a fine collection of haunting tales from an area that is woefully underrepresented in this genre of book and he is to be thanked for his efforts.

He derides the author for describing Fort Pillow as \\"crescent-shaped.\\" The reviewer scornfully claims that the fort was a shallow \\"w\\" in shape.   <br /> <br />If you google the term, \\"Fort Pillow\\" and \\"crescent,\\" guess what pops up? Among other things, a reproduction of Nathan Bedford Forrest's after action report about the capture of Fort Pillow.  Guess what the \\"Wizard of the Saddle\\" describes the fort as being shaped like?  Here's what he said in the report: <br /> <br />\\"The fort is an earth-work, crescent shaped, is 8 feet in height and 4 feet across the top, surrounded by a ditch 6 feet deep and 12 feet in width, walls sloping to the ditch but perpendicular inside.\\" <br /> <br />Personally, I would take the impression of the man who captured the place over any reviewer here.  I wonder what Forrest would have to say to him? (probably something memorably profane). <br /> <br />Now, let's talk about the endpaper map:  I've looked at it too.  First, it isn't that [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K a map.  If I had been the author, I would have found a better, clearer one.  But it doesn't show barracks or anything else in the Mississippi River! <br /> <br />I'm not saying this book is perfect, but people need to have a sense of proportion.  Does it really matter in a study on the massacre at Fort Pillow whether the author placed a statue of Andrew Jackson in the wrong city?  Getting the description of the fort wrong as the \\"one star\\" reviewer so clearly did is a worse error than something like that.   <br /> <br />The bit about the Army of Tennessee is a legitimate ding, but people ought to think about the odds that in a book that is 530 pages long, anyone could get all of the thousands of facts contained within it correct.   <br /> <br />As far as the idea that the book is some sort of hatchet job on Nathan Bedford Forrest, that is just that reviewer's interpretation.Forrest came up the hard way.  He was a slave trader, and I think one had to be pretty hard-minded to prosper at it the way he did.  He was also a military genius.  But he allowed the massacre at Fort Pillow to take place.  Does that mean he was monster?  No.  It just means that there's a shadow across his reputation --just like the role he played in setting up the KKK after the Civil War.	2005-10-13

I am an obsessive fantasy football player who loved the idea that someone would \\"abandon a successful career to make fantasy football his full-time job.\\"  The possibilities are endless, but sadly Mark St. Amant just doesn't explore enough of them.  The man announces that winning his fantasy league is his absolute priority in life, but he doesn't buy himself NFL Sunday ticket, seems to travel on half the Sundays of the year and seemingly goes to bed in the 3rd quarter of Monday Night Football every week.  Give me a break.  What kind of commitment is that?   <br /> <br />If you've ever played fantasy football (even if you're terrible), don't expect to learn anything from this book, other than maybe the origins of the hobby (which are disputed and just aren't that interesting after all).  He has all the time in the world to concentrate on his team but he never pulls off a single interesting trade, can't come up with a team name that's even mildly humorous, and doesn't offer a single peice of advice that a new player wouldn't figure out in his first five weeks of playing. <br /> <br />Finally, Bill Simmons should get royalties for this book.  Many of the references are just shamelessly \\"borrowed\\" from ESPN's popular and infinitely funnier Sports Guy.  The O.C., Billy Zabka, Jame Gumb, gouging his own eyes out with frustration and the list goes on and on and on.  C'mon, Mark, get your own style. <br /> <br />I summary, the author wasted a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K idea.  It's not insightful, there is no climax to speak of, and worst of all, it's just not funny.

Perhaps \\"A Textbook in Eisogesis\\" or \\"Constructing Complex Theology From Non-Supporting Scriptures.\\" And really this book is an adventure in poor use of Scripture and unsupported statements.<br /><br />Let me say from the beginning that I believe silence is important. I believe solitude is important. Both are important parts of a healthy spiritual walk. I also believe in the importance of meditation, albiet meditation in a Puritan sense rather than an Eastern sense of the word. While these are good and necessary parts of a healthy spirituality, they are also dangerous if misused, and particularly dangerous if used in ways not only unsupported, but forbidden by Scripture.<br /><br />In Invitation to Solitude and Silence, Ruth Haley Barton seeks to lead the reader to prayer beyond words. \\"Much of our faith and practice is about words - preaching, teaching, talking with others. Yet all of these words are not enough to take us into the real presence of God where we can hear his voice. This book is an invitation to you to meet God deeply and fully outside the demands and noise of daily life\\" (from the back cover). This objection to vocalizing prayer is an undercurrent running throughout the book.<br /><br />The reader will doubtless not be surprised to learn that the primary Bible passage used to support Barton's theology of silent prayer is 1 Kings 19, where Elijah hears God's still small voice or a small sound or thin silence or a low whisper, depending on the translation. From this single passage, Barton draws out a complex theology of silent prayer wherein we will only fully experience God if we engage in this practice.<br /><br />According to Barton there are two primary reasons to enter into the silence. The first is to commune with God. She indicates that while words are useful, we sometimes use them too often and we can use them to express everything but matters of the heart. She encourages the reader to distinguish between heart and mind and to reduce the number of words in prayer while focusing instead on just being in prayer. The second reason to engage in silent prayer is to listen to God and receive guidance from Him.<br /><br />When discussing guidance Barton writes, \\"The fact that we can't see God makes it easy to slip into a pattern of doing all the talking ourselves. Is it too much to expect that God might speak back to us, not only with expressions of love but with guidance that is trustworthy and wise? Is it grandiose to believe God might actually interact with me in such a person and timely way? And if I do hear something, how do I know it is God's voice and not just my own thoughts masquerading as something more spiritual?\\" (page 118). The answer, of course, is that we do expect God to speak to us and to do so in a deeply personal way. Yet Scripture does not tell us that we should expect the type of personal revelation this book advocates. God speaks to use as the Holy Spirit applies Scripture to our hearts. This may be unsatisfying for people who desire to experience God in their way, in their time and on their terms, but this is what the Bible clearly teaches.<br /><br />There is [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K danger in allowing supposed personal communication from God to become normative. For example, Barton tells about God calling her to vocational, ordained ministry through her times of silence. Yet the Bible teaches with utmost clarity that women are never called to this type of ministry. She allows her personal experience to supercede the clear teaching of Scripture.<br /><br />While the book focuses primarily on a theology of silent prayer, each chapter concludes with a \\"Practice\\" section in which Barton practically applies what has been taught. Early in the book she suggests finding a sacred space and perhaps an icon or object to help focus on God. Here is an excerpt from a later chapter. \\"Take a few moments to allow your body to settle into a comfortable yet alert position. Take several deep breaths as a way of entering into the silence and making yourself present to the One who is always present with you...In your time of listening today, ask God to bring to your heart a moment in the last couple of days where you were most grateful...Is there any way God may be guiding you to choose more of what gives you life?\\"<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that Barton did not discuss the potential dangers of silent prayer. After all, this type of prayer is practiced in most of the world's religions. Many Christians believe, and with some justification I think, that entering the silence is the same for Christians as it is for Hindus or Muslims or adherents to any other system of religion. Surely it would be due diligence for Barton to warn that people may encounter forces other than God while in the silence.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that I do not recommend this book for any reason. The teaching Scripturally indefensible and potentially very dangerous. The author would have us believe that we can only truly commune with God and receive His clearest guidance if we engage in this practice. Yet she is unable to prove this with Scripture and so we must toss this teaching on the ever-growing heap of unbiblical nonsense masquerading as Christian theology.

Since this is his best known work I knew I had to check it out. It is a very engaging book about Cuban brothers trying to make it in the US during the 50's Mambo craze. The story is very entertaining as many memorable characters both fictional and real Cuban musicians from the period are introduced.<br />The story while full of colorful epsiodes is ultimately tragic as the brothers age and life takes it's toll on each of them in very different ways.<br />Hijuelos uses sexual imagery and descriptions of food to create a steamy  intensity to the story with [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K effect. That said the lurid sexual descriptions cited by many other reviewers may turn off some readers. While I was enjoying the book enough to overlook this, there are times when he does rely too much on this device and the novel starts to feel like a guilty pleasure.

Almost alone at a retreat in North Carolina, one week has stretched into three, but the real world is calling again and they must reluctantly part ways.<br /><br />Just as they reach the airport, Callie gets a phone call from Stella Gold.  Her husband Eli has just been shot by a sniper and is in surgery.  Before loosing consciousness, he specifically asked for the two of them to come.  Since Eli is such a good friend, they drop everything and rush to his bed side.<br /><br />A PI, Callie wants to figure out what happened to Eli.  The only clue is a warning from someone named Nadine.  When Eli and Stella's condo is searched, it is further proof that someone is after him.  Where might he have hidden his notes?  And why did Eli request Tom's presence?<br /><br />As this series has progressed, the plots have only gotten strong, and this book is no exception.  It starts with a bang and keeps right on going.  Every time an answer comes, it only leaves more questions.  Yet Callie and Tom keep digging, getting themselves further and further in trouble.  While some things seemed obvious a little early on, there are still several nice twists along the way that keep the reader guessing.<br /><br />Fans of the series will be happy to learn that Tom is a very active part of this book instead of only a presence like in previous entries.  In fact, we even get to learn what he does, finally.  His relationship with Callie continues to grow as she continues to move on from her husband's death.  In fact, one of the strong points of the series is watching Callie finally truly deal with her grief.<br /><br />The writing style is still a little rough, keeping the reader a little more at bay by telling instead of showing.  It's not a big problem, however, and I found myself staying up too late reading every night to see what would happen in the next chapter.<br /><br />The only problem with this book is the cliffhanger ending.  Even though I saw it coming (I've read the back of the next book already), it still left me wanting to pick up the next book right away.

Quality professional women are harder to get and no \\"tricks\\" really work.  Meeting a girl in a bar is easier than you may think because of the mere fact that the woman is at the bar to socialize and meet people.  However, remember conventional wisdom about meeting people in bars is probably true.  Look at the characters in this book and their dysfunctions: that will be the type of people you attract.  To read about someone throwing tantrums IS entertaining to live with someone like that IS NOT.<br /><br />2.  The best technique to getting women is to be successful (defined by yourself), have decent grooming about your looks, and be friendly.  If you are missing one of these factors \\"the game\\" won't work.<br /><br />3.  Psychologically, people are attracted to mates who are in their own league, for example a fit attractive \\"8\\" girl will be attracted to a 7-10 guy, or vice versa, not a guy who is a 5 and is out of shape.  Notice how most couples have mates that are similar to them in attractiveness regardless of skin color, profession, etc.; sure exceptions exist but pay attention to the majority.  People are attracted to people who are similar to themselves or who will better them not opposites (although it probably is many average mens' fantasy to find a beautiful girl who will...once again marketing/media has a very strong effect on how you perceive the world and others).  Attraction is not a choice people make solely on a few criteria unless it is short term, that is why some people give everything of themselves and nothing works.<br /><br />4.  Money is to be made by marketing things like AXE Body spray, $50,000 convertibles, \\"THE GAME-guide bible/book\\", etc. to make people think that \\"If I only had...\\" scenarios (which is fun to do) but at the end of the day men/women prefer a mate who complements them both in looks and lifestyle.<br /><br />5.  PROS: The book is entertaining and cleverly marketed but be realistic about yourself.  The book does make you think that you can go out and girls will fall all over you which in some ways is positive because it MAY give you confidence and may help you meet girls initially, but negative if you think you will get a Paris Hilton type girl to come home with you.<br /><br />6.

Some books, after all, are [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K for read-once inspiration. Other books simply demand that you get your own copy, because it's earned a spot on your shelf.<br /><br />I've been working with The Thimbleberries Guide for Weekend Quilters for the last couple of weeks, courtesy of the Scottsdale Library, and I'm just finishing up one of the quilt projects. I'm probably going to order my own copy of the book; but the key word is \\"probably\\" (as opposed to \\"definitely, I'm doing it now!\\"). It has some compelling features... though it's not perfect, either.<br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff. The 25 projects in this book are  mostly full size (double and queen-sized) quilts, though there are several smaller quilts (such as the one I chose, a table runner). Most have an accompanying project, such as pillowcases to go with the quilt, or a fabric-trimmed rug.<br /><br />Not all of them are gorgeous, but none of them are lame. The designs are primarily using traditional blocks, such as flying geese, though a few projects also incorporate applique. While the quilts aren't labeled for expected skill, they all seemed pretty straightforward to this still-a-beginner.<br /><br />One thing I *love* about the book -- and which earned it a star all on its own -- is that each project is shown with a color photo and matching quilt diagram, _plus_ another picture showing the same quilt done in different colors. That works wonders, when you're trying to visualize how this quilt will look with the fabrics you already have in your stash.<br /><br />Each project is laid out in sections, to accomodate the premise of the busy weekend quilter who can grab time in small chunks. That's a strengh of the book, but it also contributes to its weakness. (At least for me; it may work exactly the way you prefer.)<br /><br />Every project gives a complete list of fabric you'll need (1/2 yard gold print, 5/8 yard red print, etc.); that's standard. However, most quilt books have you cut all the fabric in one fell swoop, so you can get done with that task and put away the rotary cutter. Instead, this book treats each part of the project (cutting the blocks, making the border, etc.) as a separate project. You cut out the fabric for the blocks, then piece them. THEN you cut out the fabric for the quilt center, and piece that.  Then you cut for the border, etc.<br /><br />If you're really working on the weekend-quilter schedule -- just a little bit at a time -- maybe this works for you. In my case, I found it irritating. I had to leave my entire setup spread up (on the dining room table, as it happens) over the course of most of a week, as I wanted to get this silly little table runner done (in addition to working 60 hours a week). I'd rather have done ALL the cutting, then tackled the piecing. Which, of course, I could certainly have done, if I had realized the non-standard way the book presents the project. Instead, I kept being surprised that I had to cut stuff AGAIN! If you know this ahead of time, it may be less annoying; you'll expect it.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is a very good book. The author is cognizant that you have limited time, and has designed a book full of attractive, do-able quilts that you can be proud of.yard gold print, 5/8 yard red print, etc.); that's standard.

The twist of a far away time in the future, when Ancient civilization (us) has destroyed themselves by warfares and ultimate mortal engines, really made the story hard to put down. The stage was created complete with the new religions, new ways of life and new societies. All was well but I can not help if I feel something missing by the end. Perhaps it was the easiness of the author in killing many of the key characters, but I think it was necessary to picture the power of destruction of the resurrected engines or it just the quiet ending after the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K climax.

This book is exactly what its title says. If you are new to relief carving, you might think that realistic relief carving involves simply in the carving half round. But this approach will not be satisfactory. This book shows to how even very shallow relief can be amazingly realistic if proper perspective is used. The book has several simple projects in the beginning to help you master the basic principles. Then you can carve a very nice nautical scene which is detailed step by step with ample photos. He uses both standard wood carver's hand tools such as gouges and also power tools including a router and a dremel.

I don't recall the author promising that reading his book will change one's  life, or that reading Proust's work will necessarily be a life-changing experience--only that it might turn out that way. <br /> <br />I was given a dog-eared copy of How Proust Can Change Your Life by a friend whom I'd told I was considering giving Proust a go. I read maybe half of it, found it amusing, and found the portrayal of Proust amusing as well. The book seemed to fizzle out after that, but what I'd read was enough to get me started on Swann's Way. I had not expected Proust to be comical in any way, but I credit Alain de Botton for illuminating Proust's self-deprecating sense of humor. Had it not been for that, I might never have made it past the famous and seemingly interminable description of juvenile insomnia that opens Swann's Way, much less enjoyed it. <br /> <br />Five years later, I have just finished The Captive and plan to begin The Fugitive within the next month or so. Has Proust changed my life? Well, yes. His work has attuned me to the importance of paying attention, resisting the dulling effects of habit, slowing down, finding meaning in the ordinary rhythms of life, accepting the painful inevitabilities of existence, laughing at my own foibles. There's more, but I won't bore you with it. <br /> <br />Proust is not everyone's cup of tea. But he might be yours. And if he is, you're in for what can, in fact, be a life-changing experience. (At the rate I'm reading him, it could also be a lifelong experience.) You may not be happier, handsomer, thinner, richer, or smarter, but you just might have a better understanding of why being who, what, and where you are is worthy of your attention.  <br /> <br />If you're thinking about diving into Proust and not sure that it will be worth the effort, I'd recommend spending a few bucks on this primer first. If it inspires you to move on to the real thing, that's [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K. If it doesn't, you will have saved yourself hundreds of hours of what could be, for some, utter tedium. And if happiness, beauty, and wealth are what you really want, and you want them now, there's always Dr. Phil.	2005-10-13

I read it in two days, and found myself laughing out loud, which is rare.  I found the best part to be his description of becoming a 128 lb sumo wrestler, and being surrounded by \\"man fat\\" as he plowed into his opponent.  There's a photo of a race, but everybody seems to be looking behind them.  I couldn't figure it out until I started reading the chapter, that Mr. Davis decided to take up backwards running.  It's amazing the feats he attempts to conquer, in his quest for a fulfilled, exciting life.<br /><br />\\"The Underdog\\" is \\"What Color is Your Parachute\\" for an aging Gen-X, who want to feel unique and fulfilled, but have no idea how to do it.  I recommend this book, not just for being well-written and enjoyable, but also for touching on how scary it is to grow up, take on adult responsibilities, and live up to the expectations of the family, partner, and self.  Mr. Davis' self-deprecating humor is charming, and I found myself rooting for him.

The beginning is extremely captivating, and I figured I'd fly right through it, but once it backtracked to tell us how we ended up at that point in the beginning, I lost interest. Not to mention that it made me really mad, almost to where I wasn't going to finish it.<br /><br />Annie Knowles is married to Michael, whose a very busy OB/GYN at a Catholic hospital in upstate New York. On top of that he's helping an friend at a downtown clinic performing abortions. While his wife thinks it's ok, most of their friends and neighbors do not, and with Michael away so much Annie starts having an affair with Simon Hass, a once-famous painter that works at the college with her.<br /><br />Simon and his wife Lydia have a very disturbing background, and Lydia (who has some major issues) is part of Life Force, a church group run by the manipulative Pastor Tim. Life Force has been terrorizing Michael and his family because of the abortions he's been performing, even putting their lives in danger. What mad me so mad was Michael's absolute refusal to just stop doing them. If not for his wife's pleading, then for the safety of his two children. It was totally unbelievable to me that he would continue to put them in such danger, and I felt it was incredibly irresponsible.<br /><br />The overall story itself wasn't bad, and I was satisfied with the ending. Though it was all a bit predictable, it was a good book nonetheless. While it wasn't a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K book in my opinion, I'd be willing to pick up another of Ms. Brundages' books.	2005-10-13

There are probably a million books that fit this classification, with most of them falling short of solid, landing much closer to middle-of-the-road or missing the road entirely. This is the first Updike book I've ever read and it won't be the last. In the enormous world of books, that's saying something. To me, Updike has a quality many authors do not. Defining that quality is left as an exercise to the reader, since my attempts to put it into words leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br />The book is a general story of a general man in a not-so-general relationship. The circumstance are not outstanding nor are they mundane. They are interesting to read about, regardless. While the story does not entail a common set of events a most have experienced, many of the themes are real enough to make the book easy to relate to. The topic matter is real, and you don't need to suspend disbelief to get much out of it. <br /> <br />Whenever I review books, I attempt to give the review reader my take on what I found both good and bad in the pages. I'm not sure there's much of a downside here, but I'll do my best. I suppose the ordinary sense of the story does little to separate it from a lot of other \\"real life\\" books on the market today. At the same time, you might look at that as a testament to the strong core of the book. Still, the story offers no real insight to the reader, which is why this is a good book, not a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K one. Other than that, it's hard for me to find anything to complain about with this book. <br /> <br />I enjoy Updike's style and the fact he is so in touch with the real American, or human, to be more appropriate. So many hours of our lives are spent in these day-to-day scenarios that much of the subject matter is topical and easy to relate to. On the other hand, most of us don't end up in these types of stories. Still, it's easy to identify with in some ways. As they say, sex sells. Of course, itisn't that easy, since that's not really the crux of the book. <br /> <br />Adult themes are too often ignored in books these days, giving way to the endless vacuum of purported children's needs or the inane quest for love. So few books touch on the search to fill the void that burns within people. This book does almost nothing to answer the question of what that burning is, or how one might go about quenching the fire. It does, however, give the reader plenty to think about as the story explores a course of action that results from a set of choices, and what happens to the people surrounding those choices. <br /> <br />Interesting and well written. Recommended.	2005-10-13

The coming megatrend, Aburdene asserts, will not be driven by external, social, or technological forces so much as \\"the internal dimension of change\\" that will reinvent free enterprise. And she's predicting that this spiritual megatrend will take firm hold of the American way of business by, say, 2010. <br /> <br />In seven chapters the book identifies the major facets of the new megatrend, including: <br /> <br />        * The Power of Spirituality - From Personal to Organizational <br />        * The Dawn of Conscious Capitalism <br />        * Leading from the Middle <br />        * Spirituality in Business <br />        * The Values-Driven Consumer <br />        * The Wave of Conscious Solutions <br />        * The Socially Responsible Investment Boom <br /> <br />Along the way, Aburdene offers many intimate portraits of the people behind the spiritual evolution in business, from meditating CEOs to value-driven consumers and socially responsible investment counselors. In \\"Leading from the Middle,\\" Aburdene suggests that conscious capitalism will spell an end to the era of high-profile CEOs who are outrageously overpaid not only to provide symbolic leadership of corporations, but to take virtually all the credit and blame for their companies' fortunes.  <br /> <br />The question is what this and all the other \\"conscious capitalism\\" trends really portend for the future of American commerce. To Patricia Aburdene, this future will be one in which \\"the spiritual transformation of capitalism\\" will shift the American way of doing business \\"from greed to enlightened self-interest, from elitism to economic democracy, from the fundamentalist doctrine of `profit at any cost' to the conscious ideology that espouses both money and morals.\\"If the author is overly optimistic, one hopes that she's not too far off the mark. In a time when natural disasters and accelerating environmental decline are colluding with exceptional political ineptitude to stress the [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K American experiment as never before, it might just be the approaching enlightenment of capitalism that illuminates a sane, sustainable path ahead for us all. -- From the Fearless Spotlight Review by D.

Many Sci fi books, movies, etc.,(or ever series) are futuristic moral plays, and this book does take that track, but goes beyond that; it is a social and political commentary on our own time and well as a social and political commentary (and prediction) of our feature 50 years from now in 2055.<br /><br />The Basic plot is a Scientist named John Bennett found a way to slow down time and create a state of suspended animation (for lake of a better word). He was all set to reveal it to the world and receive the fame and accolades that would come with such a discovery; but a wrench is tossed into the gears of his life; when he finds out his one true love (Dawn Whitemore) is dying from a form of cancer with no treatment. He decides that they must go into the feature and find a cure using his new invention. The trip will be one way, for John Bennett did not invent a time machine alla H. G. Wells Time Machine, but a time suppression machine. He talked his friend Sam Tobin into going along for the ride (or Time hop) and soon enough Sam, Dawn and John were off to there first time hop.<br /><br />Before the time hop we get a look at types of people who live in our time and we are able to see how these types play out in 2055. When they arrive in the feature we see how the types of persons and trends of today play out. How the political divisions, etc., work out. Many many theories and beliefs are looked at my Mgredechian and he really makes us all think. This book gives some answers but more so causes one to have many more questions. The characters are likable and you will want to know what happens with them.<br /><br />This book 3000 years can make a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K movie or series, for sure. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in sci fi, and I would also recommend it for anyone interested in the politics, scientific advances and a cultural trends of our day.

This book is [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K because of the exaggeration and because while I was reading it, Stephenson made the extreme stuff make sense. It's like watching a movie where the acting is so good you don't even go \\"She's a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K actor\\" because the performance has got you. He sets the tone of the craziness right from the start, establishing the rules where this book takes place. Sure college kids can relate to this book but that's not what makes it [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K. Actually I read this book and didn't think about college too much at all and I was in a FRAT! hohoho. I definitely liked this more than his later books the whole Baroque Cycle, I barely got through cryptonomicon. I like his sense of humor so Zodiac, Snowcrash, and some of Diamond Age was more my style, along with the big U. So anyways check this book out especially if you liked snowcrash. It's pretty solid.	2005-10-13

The characters are all quirky and loveable, and are all wounded in one way or another.  Their lives intertwine when 70-year old Margaret, a lonely rich woman living in a huge Seattle mansion, is diagnosed with a brain tumor.  She makes a decision about how to live out the short remainder of her life, which brings all of these wounded souls together as a surrogate family.   <br /> <br />One of these wounded souls, a young artist named Wanda, discovers the healing art of mosaic making.  Through Wanda we discover that these broken souls, like the valuable knick knacks that she breaks for use in her mosaics, are more interesting and beautiful broken than they were whole.  <br /> <br />A [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K read that stays with you long after you put it down.	2005-10-13

I must admit trepidation as the package arrived 'for assembly'- but clearly if you are capable of cooking with ATK you should be able to assemble a simple binder.  Frankly, being able to extract the recipe and take it with me to the market [01;31m[Kgreat[m[Kly enhanced my general appreciation of the new format.  The quality of the recipes is exceptional and as always I am appreciative of the repetoire enhancement.	2005-10-13

I don't know which one I like better, his first or this one. I loved the way this book reads, and it's a [01;31m[Kgreat[m[K one to pick up and open to any page, sure to get enlightenment from any one of them! I've highlighted so much in this book. Eckhart has a way with words that just sink in. This is an excellent book and one to definitely re-read!	2005-10-13
